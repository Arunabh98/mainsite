<h3>Components Required-</h3><p>We bought all the components from one of the two places-Lamington Road,Mumbai and Mangaldeep Stores,Powai.</p><p>.</p><p>The components include: </p><p>1.Acryllic sheet(3mm) </p><p>2. 38gm Servo motors(Robokit V3003 servo motor) (x4)</p><p>3. 9gm Servo motors (x2)</p><p>4.6V lead acid battery </p><p>5. 9V Batteries (x2)</p><p>6. Arduino Uno with cord. (other arduino board will also work)</p><p>7.Basic electronic components like Jumper wires,Resistances,Capacitors. </p><p>8.Bondtite glue,fevikwik </p><p>9.Bluetooth module </p><p>10.Ultrasonic sensor </p><p>11.A laptop with arduino 1.6.4 and required drivers installed in it. </p><p>12.Acryllic Paint. </p><p>13.LM7805 IC's,PCB</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><h3>Details of project-</h3><p>-</p><p>1.We made a solidworks model of bot,specifying the exact dimensions of all the parts.We first calculated some parameters such as weight,and dimensions of motors,after which we prepared the model.</p><p>2.We then prepared the mechanical structure of the bot.</p><p>3.We worked on synchronizing the four leg servo motors for forward and backward motions of the bot.</p><p>4.We then worked on turning the bot.Coding in arduino.</p><p>5.We prepared the GUI in processing to link with arduino.Coding in processing.</p><p>6.We worked on designing the PCB.</p><p>7.We designed the circuit for bluetooth module,and ultrasound sensor.</p><p>8.Final debugging and painting of the bot.</p>
