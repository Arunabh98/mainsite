UltraSound Sensor :-</span></strong></h5><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ultrasound sensor can be used for measuring distance in the range of 2cm to 3m or so, depending upon the specifications of the product. We used a common ultrasound sensor which is easily available in the market.</strong><br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>We used HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor to provide distance sensing to the robot, and to avoid obstacles on automatic mode. While on automatic mode, HC-SR04 continuously transmit distance to arduino board, and according to the code sends a interrupt when the distance is less than 15cm or so(sign of obstacle in front of robot). The interrupt causes the robot to turn left and then continue to move forward.</strong></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong> This is the picture of the connection between arduino and HC-SR04 during debugging.</strong></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><br></strong><p style="margin-left: 180px;"><strong><img src="http://mlb-s2-p.mlstatic.com/sensor-de-distancia-ultrasnico-arduino-pic-etc-14622-MLB183551934_8591-O.jpg"></strong></p><h5><span style="color: rgb(227, 108, 9);"><strong><inline style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">3. Bluetooth Module:-</inline></strong></span></h5><p><strong>To convert the robotic control into wireless mode, we used a bluetooth module, that is easily available in the market HC-05, having a sufficient range on line of sight. It allows external power source for arduino and other parts of circuits on kept on robot. We need to configure  HC-05 with our computer once, after which using our INTERFACE we can directly control our robot without even moving from our desk !!!.</strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(149, 55, 52);">A NOTE OF CAUTION :</span> While programming the arduino you need to free the TX and RX pins of arduino board , otherwise it will show the PORT busy. After uploading the code you can reconnect the pins as shown below. On Arduino UNO board TX and Rx pins are 0 and 1. In other boards they might be different.</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><img src="http://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/8GM6/H1QML3ZC/F4H8GM6H1QML3ZC.LARGE.jpg"></strong></p></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>
