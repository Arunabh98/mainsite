<p>WE HAVE USED STANDARD BARCODES [ISBN] TO "STAMP" EACH BOOK WITH A PARTICULAR NUMBER ,THE USER WILL ENTER THE NAME OF THE BOOK AND THIS NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER (BARCODE NUMBER).</p><p>WE HAVE A CAMERA MOUNTED WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE COMPUTER.THE CAMERA IS MOUNTED ON A MOVING MECHANISM WHICH ALLOWS THE CAMERA A 2 DEGREE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT .THUS ALLOWING IT TO SCAN THE BOOKS FROM 2 TO 3 SHELVES .</p><p>THE CAMERA TAKES IN THE FEED AND SENDS IT TO THE COMPUTER. EACH BARCODE HAS A YELLOW STRIP ATTACHED TO IT . THE COMPUTER SCANS THE IMAGE AND IF IT FINDS THAT YELLOW ,IT INSTRUCTS THE MOVEMENT OF THE CAMERA TO STOP.BY SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE ARDUINO TO STOP.</p><p>NEXT IT SCANS THE BARCODE AND CHECKS WHETHER THE BARCODE IT HAS SCANNED IS SAME AS THE BARCODE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOOK THT THE USER WANTS.</p><p>OF IT IS THEN WELL AND GOOD , OUR PROGRAM STOPS AND THE LAST POSITION OF THE CAMERA INDICATES THE POSITION OF THE BOOK YOU WANT..</p><p>IF IT IS NOT THE BARCODE THAT WE WANT ..  COMPUTER SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE ARDUINO TO MOVE OUT SO THAT THE YELLOW IS NOT IN THE FIELD OF VIEW ANYMORE.</p><p>THIS WILL KEEP HAPPENING TILL WE REACH THE BOOK WE WANT....</p>
