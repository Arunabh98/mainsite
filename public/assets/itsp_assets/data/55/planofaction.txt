<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?<br><ul><li>The basic theory behind the project</li><li>Components required</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished?<br><ul><li>Complete theory was prepared</li><li>Some basic components were finalized</li></ul></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<br><ul><li>Finalizing all the electrical components and buy it</li><li>Learn some basic softwares like Arduino, Eagle, AVR</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Ordered all the electrical components and bought the basic stuff (wires, etc)</li><li>Learnt basic Arduino, Eagle, AVR (Atmega 32)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:
<ul>
<li>Buy the mechanical parts like plywood, nuts and bolts, etc</li><li>Start coding with the Ultrasonic Sensor and Piezo Sensor</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What we achieved
<ul>
<li>Bought plywood and gave the skateboard the desired shape and size</li><li>Ultrasonic Sensor successfully tested</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>Get the necessary strong (capable of bearing weight of a person) wheels</li><li>Fit the wheels with the skateboard</li><li>Study the connections (connectors) needed for series and parallel connections of the batteries</li><li>Program the ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>Got the desired wheels but not able to attach them with the skateboard :(</li><li>Connectors and necessary stuff were ordered</li><li>ESCs were ready</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>Attach the wheels, batteries and all the sensors with the skateboard</li><li>Make some way out to apply brakes to skateboard</li><li>Complete the electrical circuit on Arduino containing Piezo, Ultrasonic Sensors and ESCs</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>All parts were successfully attached</li><li>Circuit was ready but wires of that much capacity were not available</li><li>Brakes were still left</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 14th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?
<ul>
<li>Make the brakes and start testing the skateboard</li><li>Debugging</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Brakes were successfully finished</li><li>Skateboard was tested and debugged the bugs</li></ul></li></ul>
