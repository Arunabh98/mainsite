<div>The mechanism used in the bot is the Rack and Pinion and the law that is involved in the climbing of bot is the very basic NEWTON's third law of motion.The bot climbs the step due to forces of thrust from the rack and the friction acting tangentially on the spinning wheels from the walls.    </div>
