</ol><p>     The bot has 2 big wheels and a caster wheel that are the only contacts with the ground while moving normally on the ground.As soon as the bot comes in contact with a step, we provide a fourth contact i.e, the rubber stud. This stud is attached to the case's bottom.This contact is pushed away from the bot through rack and pinion system which takes the bot to the next stair.</p><p>As mentioned before, the basis for our bot is purely mechanical. As the pinion rotates, the rack is pushed back, this provides the main thrustforce required for the bot to move up</p><p>Problems Faced: The problem faced in making this bot was getting the mechanical parts with desired specifications.We had to manufacture most of the parts in the bot. </p><p>Model 2:</p></div>
<div>Problems Faced:</div><div>To increase the strength of the rack and pinion mechanism we had to use a metal case to hold the rack which itself would slide in another metal case fixed to the chasis which on whole increased the weight of the bot and also increased the friction for the rack holder to move.Hence, the outer case had to be removed.Then the design was changed such that the rack holder would slide on chasis directly on ball bearings which made rack holder to slide easily and its side movement was restricted by L-clamps.</div><ol>Problems Faced:<br> Since the whole body was handmade it was unstable in the initial phases.</ol>
