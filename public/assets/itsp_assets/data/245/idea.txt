</ol><p>The glove that will control
the mechanical assembly was equipped with flex
sensors and accelerometers.</p><p>Flex sensors-They are analog resistors. They
work as analog voltage dividers. Inside the flex sensors are carbon resistive
elements within a thin flexible substrate (more carbon means less resistance).When
the substrate is bent, the sensor produces a resistance output relative to the
bend radius.</p><p>Thus bending of flex sensors which are
attached rigidly to the fingers of our glove will rotate the respective servo
and consequently will give the motion to the finger of our mechanical arm.</p><p>Accelerometers-An <strong>accelerometer</strong> is a device that measures proper acceleration("g-force"). Proper acceleration is not the same as
coordinate acceleration (rate of change of velocity). </p><p>Some smartphones, digital audio players and personal digital assistants contain accelerometers for user interface
control; often the accelerometer is used to present landscape or portrait views of the device's screen, based on the way the device is being held.</p><p>Thus, when they are tilted
they give different output values which are then synchronized with the servos
and consequently produces motion. We are using accelerometers for controlling
the palm’s and elbow’s motion.</p><p>Servos-</p><p>A servomechanism, sometimes shortened to servo, is an automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the performance of a mechanism and is defined by its function. It usually includes a built-in encoder. A servomechanism is sometimes called a hetero-stat since it controls a system's behavior by means of heterostasis.
The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed or other parameters. For example, an automotive power window control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position—the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car's cruise control uses closed loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism.In the project the servo is mapped appropriately with the values of flex sensors and accelerometers.</p><p>The flex Sensor                                                             </p><p><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/gosloy7zb/images.jpg">           </p><p><em>The Accelerometer</em></p><p><img src="http://s24.postimg.org/v6wqh94hx/download_2.jpg"></p><p>The Servo</p><p><img src="http://s10.postimg.org/p1755jt6x/Continuous_Rotation_Servo.jpg" style="width: 394px;"></p><br></div><ol><br></ol>
