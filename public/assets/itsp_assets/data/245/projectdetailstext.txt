<p><strong><em>Learning and Experiences</em></strong></p><p>One sentence, "You have no better option than ITSP to spend
your freshie year summers!!". The positives which one can take from doing
ITSP is something which can't be compared with anything else. This had been a
vast learning experience for all of us. The best part was that one had to start
from literally zero to make the project.</p><p>The main things we learnt in this project are- Team-spirit, Work discipline,
softwares, about new sensors, to make mechanical design properly after many
attempts of failures</p><p>But that one line said by Edison was our motivation-</p><p>"I have not failed.
I've just found 10000 ways that won't work.</p><p><strong>Lesson Learnt</strong>: The lesson which we learnt which is so obvious but we often tend
to forget it : "You will be able to scorch out more and more
earthworms the deeper and deeper you will dig into the soil!!". One pain
doesn't ends while you realise the other one is waiting there on the door but
this is what life is all about. </p><p><strong><em>Problems Faced</em></strong></p><p>·Choosing the right Servo
Motors.·Doing proper mapping for
flex sensors and accelerometers.</p><p>·Material for arm</p><p>·After looking at various
options such as acrylic, aluminium , we finally settled for a design that has
different parts of different components. The components used  are acrylic for aelbow, plastic for palm,
tubing for fingers, wood and aluminium for support and hinge. </p><p>·We used a hand drill to
drill holes in aluminium ,acrylic, fans of servos</p><p>·The code we wrote gave
multiple angles for a given set of x,y,z coordinates during simulation stage
itself (which is a big benefit, had it been tested directly on the equipment,
the arm would have dismantled due to the rapid changes in position)</p><p>·Code algorithm improved
and constraints on angles put to give a single solution.</p><p>Here is our code-</p><p>#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;</p><p>
