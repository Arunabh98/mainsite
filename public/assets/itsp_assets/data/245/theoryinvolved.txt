or may be part of a more complex robot. The links of such a manipulator are connected
by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as in an articulated robot) or translational (linear) displacement. The links of the manipulator can be considered
to form a kinematic chain. The terminus of the kinematic chain of the
manipulator is called the end effevtor and it is analogous to the human hand.</span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span></em></p><p>The degrees of freedom, or DOF, is a very important term to understand. Each degree of freedom is a joint on the arm, a place where it can bend or rotate or translate. You can typically identify the number of degrees of freedom by the number of actuators on the robot arm. Now this is very important - when building a robot arm you want as few degrees of freedom allowed for your application!!! Why? Because each degree requires amotor, often an encoder.</p><p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">The palm and elbow have one each
RTOF(rotational degree of freedon).And the fingers have coiling motion (in one
direction.).In total there are total 5 degrees of freedom .</span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Robotic glove houses the circuitry
which controls the robotic arm. It consists of Arduino Uno which is programmed
in such a way that it takes the data from the sensors on the glove and transfer
it to the Mechanical assembly ofrobotic arm. The Accelerometer installed takes
the angles (alpha, beta and gamma ) and acceleration in all three directions of
the hand respectively, sends the signals to the Arduino Uno via wires where the
values are combined and processed simultaneously. At the same time the Flex
sensor is doing its job by sending the degree of movement of the finger to the
Arduino uno. The processed values are then transmitted) to the robotic arm.</span> </em></p><p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_Getting_Started"></a></p>
