<p><strong>1.SOLAR PANEL</strong></p><p><strong>Working of Solar Panel</strong>-</p><p>Under
the sun, a photovoltaic cell acts as a photosensitive diode that
instantaneously converts light – but not heat – into electricity.</p><p><strong>Cell Layers</strong></p><p>A top, phosphorus-diffused
silicon layer carries free electrons – un-anchored particles with negative
charges. A thicker, boron doped bottom layer contains holes, or absences of
electrons, that also can move freely. In effect, precise manufacturing has
instilled an electronic imbalance between the two layers.</p><p><img src="http://st.depositphotos.com/1763191/2935/v/950/depositphotos_29356945-Solar-Energy-Diagram.jpg"></p><p>This Video

Lithium-ion batteries are the most used mobile batteries in
smartphones nowadays.</p><p><strong>CHARGING
AND DISCHARGING OF BATTERY</strong></p><p><strong></strong>They hold their charge. A lithium-ion battery pack loses only
about 5 percent of its charge per month, compared to a 20 percent loss per
month for NiMH batteries. They have no<strong>memory effect</strong>, which
means that you do not have to completely discharge them before recharging, as
with some other battery chemistries.Lithium-ion batteries
can handle hundreds of charge/discharge cycles.That is not to say that
lithium-ion batteries are flawless. They have a few disadvantages as well.They
start degrading as soon as they leave the factory. They will only last two or
three years from the date of manufacture whether you use them or not.They are
extremely sensitive to high temperatures. Heat causes lithium-ion battery packs
to degrade much faster than they normally would.If you completely discharge a
lithium-ion battery, it is ruined.</p><p><img src="http://www.enerdel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lithium-cell-graphic-300x289.jpg"></p><p><strong>GUIDE

of an android app was required because the system variables holding the value the
charge left in the battery cannot be accessed by external circuits.</p><p>To learn to make android app</p><p>Follow this link:</p><p>http://www.developer.android.com</p><p><strong></strong></p>
