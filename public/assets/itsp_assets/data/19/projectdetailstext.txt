<p><strong>A solar panel converts solar energy into electrical energy. Solar mobile charger regulates this electrical energy such that it could be used to charge mobile phones. </strong>Solar mobile charger is a device which can charge mobile phones using solar radiation. Its major component is a compact solar panel. This solar panel traps solar energy and produces an output voltage. But, since the light radiations falling on the solar panel can vary, the output voltage becomes unstable. For charging a mobile phone, stable voltage is required. So, to make the output voltage stable and regulated, we use a voltage regulator circuit along with the solar panel.</p><p>Most of the mobile phones have computer connectivity via USB cable. USB port establishes 4 connection terminals. The connection terminals at the two extreme ends are the supply terminals. In a female USB connector (port via which we plug in USB devices to computer), these terminals carry 5V DC. When a mobile phone is connected to the USB port of a computer, it utilizes this 5V supply to recharge battery. This feature is used in a solar mobile charger. It converts and regulates solar energy to 5V DC and the output will be available through the female USB connector. To this connector, we can easily connect a mobile phone via data cable.</p><p><img src="http://www.techulator.com/attachments/Resources/10562-8141-Solar-Mobile-Charger.jpg" alt="Solar Mobile Charger"></p><p>We have soldered all the components as per the circuit. Since the output should be constant and it can be any value between 4.75 V and 5.25 V, the regulator does the job of maintaining this value. We have placed a diode in the circuit before the PORT in order to ensure that there is no back flow of the energy.</p><p>The next part is about the battery backup and the android application.</p><p>We did a android application that gives a clap noise when the charge is below 35 percentage and above 90 percentage. The android application is mainly to ensure that there is always sufficient amount of charge in the mobile.For the automatic part we did a sound detection circuit which switches ON or OFF by the noise of a clap.</p><p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-64JyhlL4Jkw/UUyGliHe5QI/AAAAAAAADvg/7WrG2wMmGiQ/s400/simple+clap+switch+circuit.jpg"></p><p>The above diagram is the clap-switch circuit. The first stage comprising T1 and T2 forms a hi-gain voltage amplifier configuration. A mic is connected at the base of T1 via blocking capacitor C1. Strong sound vibration hitting the mic is instantly picked and converted into tiny electrical pulses. These are in fact small AC pulses easily make there way through C1 into the base of T1. This creates a kind of push-pull effect and T1 also conducts in the corresponding way.However the response of T1 is relatively weak and requires further amplification.Transistor T2 is introduced exactly for this and helps to improve the voltage peaks created by T1 to appreciable levels (almost equal to the supply voltage.)</p><p>The above voltage pulse is now ready to be use for toggling the flip flop and is fed to the relevant stage.IC 4017 as we all know produces sequential shifting of its output pin-outs (logic high) in response to every positive pulse at its clock input pin 14.The amplified clap sound voltage pulse is applied to pin 14 of the above IC, this flips the output of the IC to either a logic high or a logic low depending upon the initial status of the relevant pin-out.This triggered output is appropriately collected at the diode junctions abd used to toggle a relay through a relay driver transistor T4. The relay contacts of this clap switch ultimately goes to a load or an appliance which is correspondingly switched ON and OFF with every subsequent claps.It even works When the clap sound hits the mic, a momentary drop of voltage is experienced at pin#2 of the IC, this situation raises the voltage at pin#3 of the IC for that instant.As we know, with pin#3 at higher potential than pin#2 makes the output of the IC high, the condition puts the output of the IC go high momentarily.</p><p>This high response triggers the IC 4017 pin#14, and forces its output to either move from pin#2 to pin#3 or vice versa depending upon the initial situation of the outputs.<br>The above action switches the load accordingly either to ON or OFF position.</p><p><strong></strong></p>
