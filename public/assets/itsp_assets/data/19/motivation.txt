<p>The reliance on small devices and the ones which makes easier the daily tasks
increases every day. With advances in solar technology, batteries and electronics in
general, have been increasingly possible to develop new devices that require less
energy to operate. Of course all mobile devices (without network connection) could
have, because the power required for solar modules is suitable for battery use.
Furthermore, mini charge regulators that reach the maximum power devices without
causing overload of the batteries.</p><p>Portable devices (mobile phones, tablets, notebooks and netbooks) have
become increasingly popular, especially with the proliferation of access to wireless
technology. One of its main characteristics is to rely on battery power for its operations.
Techniques that allow energy savings, therefore, have been researched to meet the
need for immediacy in which the world currently requires.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>In order to overcome the present challenges in the world and to fulfill the necessity of the present generation, we did a solar mobile charger with automatic power backup. The main theme of this project is to charge the mobile with the solar energy, that is present in abundance in nature. The project also provides a automatic power backup which runs with the help of  a android application.</strong></p>
