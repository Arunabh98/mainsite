<p><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">CONSERVATION OF SOLAR ENERGY-</span></strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">This whole project was only
aimed to reap the fruits of renewable energy like  solar energy.In tropical countries like
INDIA, there  is a greater percentage of
sunny days.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">It would be foolish if such a
great resource is overlooked.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Mainly, Solar energy can be used to convert it into
heat energy or it can be converted into electricity. Solar energy can be
converted into electricity by means of solar thermal energy and photovoltaic.
Through Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) cells, solar radiation gets converted into DC
electricity directly. This form of energy can be used to power solar watches,
calculators or traffic signals. They are often used in locations that are not
connected to electricity grid. Solar heat energy can be used to heat water or
space heating which means heating the space inside the building.</span></p><p><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">RELAY SWITCH-</span></strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">A <strong>relay </strong>is an electrically  operated switch.
Many relays use an electromagnet  to mechanically operate a switch, but other
operating principles are also used, such as solid state  relays. Relays are used where it is necessary to control
a circuit by a low-power signal (with complete electrical isolation between
control and controlled circuits), or where several circuits must be controlled
by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the
signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. </span></p><p><strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">CHARGING
AND DISCHARGING OF BATTERY-</span></strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">During charging, the positive active material is oxidized , producing electrons, and the negative
material is reduced, consuming electrons. These electrons
constitute the current  flow in the external circuit. The electrolyte  may serve as a simple buffer for internal ion flow between the electrodes, as in lithium-ion and nickel-cadmium cells, or it may be an
active participant in the electrochemical  reaction, as in lead-acid cells.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The energy used to charge rechargeable batteries usually comes
from a battery charger  using AC mains electricity, although some are
equipped to use a vehicle's 12-volt DC power outlet. Regardless, to store
energy in a secondary cell, it has to be connected to a DC voltage source. The
negative terminal of the cell has to be connected to the negative terminal of
the voltage source and the positive terminal of the voltage source with the
positive terminal of the battery. Further, the voltage output of the source
must be higher than that of the battery, but not<em>much</em>higher: the greater the difference
between the power source and the battery's voltage capacity, the faster the
charging process, but also the greater the risk of overcharging and damaging
the battery.</span></p><p><strong></strong></p>
