<p>We have made an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) which moves in a particular direction and avoids all the obstacles in its pathway. The basic idea of the project was to make a robot vehicle which will detect all the obstacles in its pathway and avoid them very smartly.We used an ultrasonic sensor and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) along with Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller to accomplish this.</p><p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/FCS-MULE-ARV-2007.jpg"></a></p><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/FCS-MULE-ARV-2007.jpg"></p>
