<h3><strong>ARDUINO UNO Rev3:</strong></h3><p><img src="http://store.arduino.cc/bmz_cache/4/4578f41d9764a5c236470019f05dd2bc.image.447x354.jpg" style="width: 288px;"></p><ul><li>The Arduino UNO R3 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.<br>The UNO differs from all preceding boards because it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip.<br>Additional features coming with the REV3 version are:<br><ul><li>ATmega16U2 instead of 8U2 as USB-to-Serial converter.</li><li>1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins for TWI communication placed near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board and the second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes.</li><li>Stronger RESET circuit.</li></ul><p>"Uno" means "One" in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform.</p></li><li><h4>Technical specifications</h4><table>

<li>NPN is one of the two types of bipolar transistors, consisting of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the emitter of an NPN transistor to its base (i.e., when the base is <strong>high</strong> relative to the emitter) as well as positive potential difference measured from the base to the collector, the transistor becomes active. In this "on" state, current flows between the collector and emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN becauseelectron mobility is higher than hole mobility.</li><li>View <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/661741.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet (2N-4401)</a></li></ul>

<li>The <strong>2N7000</strong> is a  N-channel, enhancement-modeMOSFETs used for low-power switching applications.</li><li> Typical use of these transistors is as a switch for moderate voltages and currents, including as drivers for small lamps, motors, and relays. In switching circuits, these FETs  can be used much like bipolar junction transistors, but have some advantages:<br>
<ul>
<li>low threshold voltage means no gate bias required</li><li>high input impedance of the insulated gate means almost no gate current is required</li><li>consequently no current-limiting resistor is required in the gate input</li></ul><p> The main disadvantages of these FETs over bipolar transistors in switching are the following:</p><ul>
<li>susceptibility to cumulative damage from static discharge prior to installation</li><li>circuits with external gate exposure require a protection gate resistor or other static discharge protection</li><li>Non-zero ohmic response when driven to saturation, as compared to a constant junction voltage drop in a bipolar junction transistor</li></ul></li><li>View <a href="https://www.fairchildsemi.com/datasheets/2N/2N7000.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet (2N-7000)</a></li></ul><hr>

In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megohms (MΩ), while in the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency, photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering resistance. The resistance range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photoresistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands.</p><p>View <a href="http://www.biltek.tubitak.gov.tr/gelisim/elektronik/.../LDR_NSL19_M51.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet (LDR)</a></p><hr><h3>RELAY ( JQC-3FC-T73 5V )</h3><p><img src="http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server3700/8d73a/products/364/images/962/relay__43794.1409204551.1280.1280.JPG?c=2" style="width: 261px;"></p></ul><ul><p>A relay is an electrically activated switch. It consists of a coil internally which will creates a magnetic field that attracts a movable lever and then changes switch contacts when a current is flowing through it. The typical usage of relay is to allow a low DC voltage circuit (circuit #1) to switch on or off a high voltage (DC or AC) circuit (circuit #2) without direct electrical connection between them. This means circuit #1 and circuit #2 are magnetically and mechanically linked but not electrically connected.</p><p>View <a href="http://www.langirele.com/pdf/pcb-relay-T73.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet ( JQC-3FC-T73 )</a></p></ul>
