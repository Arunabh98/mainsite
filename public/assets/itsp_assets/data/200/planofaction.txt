<h3>Week 1 (May 12th -19th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned the overview of the project.</li><li>Learned programming on arduino uno and researched on various components required in the project.</li><li>Made a rough estimation of components required and bought them</li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 20th- 27th )</h3><ul><li>Learned the AT commands and incorporated the GSM Module with the Arduino to serve basic purposes such as sending and receiving SMS.</li><li>We tried to light up an LED using simple a command through SMS.</li><li>The power from the arduino was not enough to light up the LED as the GSM Module consumed high power from the arduino.</li><li>Searched for alternatives to solve the problem.</li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 28th - June 3rd)</h3><ul><li>Mosfets, Relays and Transistors<br><ul><li>Successfully integrated the transistors to light LEDS</li><li>For fan and door lock motors we used mosfets and relays which served our purpose.  </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Coding<ul><li>Coded the Arduino to manipulate light and fan via SMS.</li></ul></li><li>Wanted to use PIR Sensor to detect person inside room and auto door lock.<ul><li>Due to limitations other alternatives thought.</li><li>Studied on working of LDR's.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (June 4th - June 11th)</h3><ul><li>LDR Lazer sensor replaces PIR Sensor.<br><ul>
<li>Assembled the componenets on bread board and programmed the Arduino accordingly.</li><li>Did test runs and found many faults in the code.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished<br><ul><li>Debugging in progress</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 12th - 19th)</h3><ul><li>Contructed a portable plywood model.</li><li>Fitted a door with gear and rack mechanism.</li><li>Installed the required components onto the model.</li><li>Debugging<ul><li>Did final test runs on the new model</li><li>Modified the code accordingly</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished<ul><li>The test runs were successful.</li><li>The code was finalized and indented. </li></ul></li><li>Finalization<ul><li>Project video file uploaded</li><li>Presentation were completed</li><li>The final project was submitted</li></ul></li></ul><h3></h3><ul>
