<p>Gone
are the days when you would look up and curse yourself for being out on a hot
sunny day. Take pride, very soon you will be walking with energy station with
people asking you to help them charge their batteries with your clothes. This
is not a scene out of a Science-Fiction movie. It is the simple application of solar
cells. They are only way we can convert sunlight into electricity directly and
day by day they are getting better ,smaller , cheaper. Nothing can dare challenge the sun when
it comes to radiant energy. Every hour
the energy available from the sun is more than human’s requirement for an entire
year . Petrol , diesel and all these fossil fuels are nothing but sun’s
concentrated over year and years. This makes them very efficient in terms of
energy per unit of the fuels . so why not tap it directly.</p><p><img src="http://www.deparsolar.com/images/data/solar-energy-panels-720.jpg"></p><p>Nowadays
there is an increase in demand for battery backup as a power outage is highly
not desirable. Recently
there has been developments in this area and the market for power backup is
growing quickly. Even
though normal power backup is a good solution for preventing battery outage ,
still they need to be recharge after sometime which limits their functionality. So in order to overcome this we did a solar mobile charger with automatic power backup. The power backup runs with a support of android application, that works in a such a way that there is always sufficient amount of charge in the mobile.</p>
