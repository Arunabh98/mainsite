<h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We had planned to make a RC plane which will have two modes manual mode and automated mode. Manual mode will be used during takeoff and landing and plane will cruise in automated mode holding its attitute, further heading of plane can be set and adjusted as per requirement. The basic idea of the project was to use imu sensor MPU6050 to get the orientation of the plane and use this orientation data to control the stability and heading of the plane using Arduino platform.</span> </h5><p>                                                      <img src="http://cubeme.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Micro_Butterfly_RC_plane_manufactured_Plantraco_weighs1.jpg"></p>
