<p>Our Project
mainly works at Software end. We had to develop a Speech Recognition system in
PC. For the IDE we chose MATLAB. The basic Concept was to develop a decent
enough Speech Recognition system so that we may be able to identify single word
commands.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Voice
Processing:</strong></p><p>The voice Processing had two parts. One for
PC and one for Android device.</p><p>  In
case of Android device we directly used Google API to process the voice and
give commands.</p><p>  But
for PC we had to develop the algorithm to calculate MFCC (Voice Processing) and
DTW (Speech Recognition).</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Image
Processing :</strong></p><p>For Image Processing we used the basic algorithm to first reduce
the Image to smaller array in order to be able to compare the pre-defined
properties for shape identification.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Bluetooth Module :</strong></p><p>Serial communication was incorporated to serially send data i.e commands
for executing the motions in bot.</p><p>Bluetooth Module is needed to communicate between Android
application/PC Software and Arduino.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Android
Application :</strong></p><p>We also developed our own android application to control the Bot.
This app was developed using <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">MIT
App Inventor</a>. The application contains options for both Manual as well as
Voice Controls.</p><p><img src="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/sites/all/themes/appinventor/logo.png"></p>
