<p style="text-align: center;">We planned on making a basic <strong>Wireless Voice Controlled bot</strong> which can be controlled using either an Android Device or PC. For
Wireless communication we have used Bluetooth as it is easily accessible, cheap and
also easy to use. The bot can follow basic commands like 'forward', 'backward', 'left', 'right' and 'stop'. The design of bot is simple too. It is powered by 2 300 RPM motors controlled by Arduino UNO via L293D dual H Bridge.</p>
