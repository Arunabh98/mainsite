<p><strong>Working of our project :-</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/1xEYcy3i.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/1xETMRFV.png"></p><p><strong>Communication :-</strong></p><p>For communication between
the Bot and PC/Android device Bluetooth Module HC-05 has been used. The
communication is at 9600 baud. The Bluetooth communication can be started from
PC Software as well as from Android Application. (The PC must have a Bluetooth
Driver and Hardware installed).</p><p><strong>About Bluetooth Module ‘HC-05’
:</strong><img src="https://alselectro.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ard.png"></p><p>For Connection of Bluetooth
Module with Arduino UNO :</p><p>a. Add a Supply of 5V to
HC-05 VCC port from Arduino UNO 5V Pin.</p><p>b. TX pin from the module
is connected to RX pin of Arduino (Important).</p><p>c. RX pin from the module
is connected to TX pin of Arduino (Important).</p><p>d. Provide GND to the
module from Arduino UNO GND.</p><p>The Pins at both ends in
the module are not used in our project.</p><p><strong>Important Notices :</strong></p><ul>
 <li>Please ensure that TX and RX of
     BT Module is connected to RX and TX of Arduino resp.</li> <li>Ensure that Bluetooth of phone
     should be turned ON before starting a connection or the list will appear blank.
     </li> <li>The voice input commands may
     have some delay in Android App due to time required for voice processing.
     In PC you are already provided only one second window.</li> <li>The Bluetooth Connection is
     stopped in Android App when one leaves the control page. Hence Bluetooth
     has to be connected every time you visit the Voice control or Manual
     Control page.</li></ul><p><strong>Future Work :</strong></p><ul>
 <li>Currently our project has a
     very limited number of commands that it can process. We can extend it
     further with greater number of commands. The bot may have a lot more
     functions that it could perform.</li> <li>The Image Processing can be
     enhanced and can be used for analyzing the Arena and identify the
     obstacles.</li></ul><p><strong>Problems faced :</strong></p><ul>
 <li>The PCB that we tried to make
     could not be completed because of some loose connections. The bot is
     currently fitted with a bread board to run the Motors.</li> <li>The Android App was not closing
     on Exit button press, we sorted that out. Currently, when the mobile can’t
     search for the device it keeps giving errors for no devices found. This
     may happen even when both devices are on. Sometimes after disconnection,
     reconnection may give errors. </li></ul>
