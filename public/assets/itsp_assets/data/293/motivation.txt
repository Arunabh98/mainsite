<p>This project was inspired by the need of hasslefree wireless communication and automation of machines. Nowadays most of the things in our life are being controlled by automated systems. So providing a voice controls helps to easily access these devices. Moreover wireless communication enables hasslefree systems. The robot provides a medium for executing basic voice commands. This project can be developed further for wider applications like wireless voice operations to some fixed system, like Jarvis!! The bot can be easily used as it only takes voice inputs for command execution. Being able to control machines using Smartphones is lot easier and helpful at times.</p>
