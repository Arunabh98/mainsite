<p><strong>Working of our project :-</strong></p><ul><li><img src="http://s9.postimg.org/wo77pmcy7/itsp.jpg"></li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Serial communication :-</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>UART protocol was used for communication of micro-controller to laptop and Bluetooth module to micro-controller . It uses an interrupt for data storage in its buffer i.e. every time       when  a single bit is send it shifts its control to store that bit in its buffer and that bit can be accessed as and when required ,and then it comes to its previous location .</p><p><strong>Bluetooth Module HC-05 :</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/v0tu7iemj/JY_MCU_Bluetooth_Module_Arduino_Uno_Connections1.png" style="width: 366px;"></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Connection of bluetooth with arduino :</p><p>a. Supply 5V to HC-05 from external source.</p><p>b. TX pin from module is connected directly to RX pin of arduino . Bluetooth module works at 3.3V, TX pin transmit this voltage to RX pin, to which arduino can deal with.</p><p>c. RX pin of arduino cannot be connected directly , as arduino signal is of 5V . So, we use a voltage divider to convert it to 3.3v and then supply to TX pin of bluetooth module.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Technical Details :</strong></p><ul><li>Server should be set up before starting the app. Also mobile and laptop i.e Server must be connected to same Wireless Network. </li><li><strong></strong>Bluetooth module HC-05 needs to paired initially with bluetooth of phone because when app starts it starts searching for paired devices and if a HC-05 is on it is connected to app. Also one needs to ensure that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth of phone should be turned ON before starting app.</li><li>As one enters in either of Automated or Manual control option in app, it sends a specific  'char'  to Arduino specifying the entered option.</li><li>If entered option is Automatic control then Arduino serially communicates with laptop specifying it to start image processing and then send the center coordinates of ball serially back to Arduino. According to displacement of center of the ball w.r.t center of the frame and also history (i.e PID) it decides angle in x and y direction to be moved. Also the angular speed with which servo moves is decided and is kept varying. All this is done at regular intervals of 200ms.</li><li>If the entered option is Manual control then Arduino only communicates with mobile for further left, right, up and down commands. Both gun and camera moves with constant angular speed.</li><li>As when user presses shot button on app every thing stops and gun takes its position (i.e. angle is slightly different as gun is at a bit distance from camera ) then after a delay of 1000ms when everything is done servo triggers the gun.</li><li>Now to again use this app for a different option one needs to start this app again.</li></ul><p><strong>Future Work :</strong></p><ul><li>Currently our project is implemented for object following but for future extensions and its application in DRDO we need to replace object recognition by face recognition</li><li>Also we are manually entering the IP of connected network in our source code which is to be replaced with automated entrance of IP address.</li></ul><p><strong> Problems faced :</strong></p><ul><li><strong></strong>Serial communication of Arduino and laptop to send integers was a big pain even due to small delays of .1ms . So instead of sending integers (i.e 4 bytes) at a time we send characters(i.e 1 byte) encoding integers and then decoding it at Arduino end.</li><li>Android Application was giving some errors such as "App stopped working " when we navigate from one page to other. We found out the error was in Bluetooth communication as connection was lost every time when we navigate in different pages. To remove this we added connection option on each and every page.</li></ul>
