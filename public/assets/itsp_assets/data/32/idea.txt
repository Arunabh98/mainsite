	Our project has camera and gun controlled by android application. To implement this we need to the following things :-</p><p>
	<strong>Pan-Tilt Mechanism :</strong></p><p>
	To provide gun and camera two rotational degrees of freedom we implemented a pan-tilt mechanism. Pan-Tilt mechanism uses two servo motors for 360 degrees of rotational freedom.</p><p>

	Thus we mounted webcam and gun at axis of tilt in the following mechanism shown using laser cut clamps and servos :</p><p>

	<strong>Image Processing :</strong></p><p>
	Image processing is used to detect contour of ball (in our case) is done on laptop itself so as to have high fps(frames-per- seconds). Image processing is done on python which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV">OpenCV</a> library to create a mask and then to detect the contour.</p><p>

	Masking and contour detection,then detection of its center</p><p>
	<strong>Serial Communication and Bluetooth Module :</strong></p><p>
Serial communication was incorporated to serially send data i.e coordinates of center of ball to Arduino Mega as detected by image processing code.</p><p>Bluetooth Module is needed to communicate between android application and system.</p><p><img src="http://s28.postimg.org/rstwqomhp/FM8_W4_A2_HKZAVRT9_LARGE.jpghttp://s28.postimg.org/rstwqomhp/FM8_W4_A2_HKZAVRT9_LARGE.jpg" style="width: 504px;"></p><p>
Arduino Code uses a PID algorithm to make camera follow that object in which error is distance moved by center of ball.</p><p><strong>Server Setup :</strong></p><p>
We created a server that continuously streams MJPEG images at high fps to our Android application . </p><p><img src="http://s3.postimg.org/sadhfdqdf/live_streaming.png" style="width: 395px;"></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Android Application :</strong></p><p>Also we created our own android application to show video which is streamed by server and to have two options of manual and automated gun con</p><p>In automated gun control webcam will follow object and in will shoot on pressing shoot button on android app whereas in manual control user will follow object shown on android application.</p><p><img src="http://s3.postimg.org/4jw0wv2rn/images.jpg"></p>
