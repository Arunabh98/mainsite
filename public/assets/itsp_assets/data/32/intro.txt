<p>We planned to build a <strong>Surveillance system</strong> to monitor a particular object . The very basic idea of the project was to help guards in maintaining a strict security system and to even provide them a secured environment. The system mainly consists of a webcam and a gun that will have 360 degrees of rotational freedom. Camera will follow a particular object either automatically or manually depending on user's need . The gun is there to shoot that object as and when directed by user.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <img src="http://s2.postimg.org/wfvlip6h5/im1.jpg" style="width: 327px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">A camera monitored system having gun to shoot enemy.</p>
