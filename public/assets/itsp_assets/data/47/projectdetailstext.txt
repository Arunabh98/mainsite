It supports Linux based <a href="https://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian </a>operating system. </p><p>Computer was connected to Raspberry Pi via a LAN cable that generates an ip address and Putty was as an connection interface between that Pi and laptop. Further graphical interface was provided by <a href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/pixming.php">Xming </a>software.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7DZ4L2NlqMfH7JBRZDbYAqzQG-nDI5rvN3hsJNVbYY-Z4b2aalYbDB9W-vrBIYftiYc-oZS4Qviqx94HWfLbdDzqlsOAJhma0LlKxSLjFjr3rh19bsq3maNzYxBgCueD_WdMdaE" width="660px;" height="369px;" style="border-style: none; border-width: initial; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); width: 545px;" alt="9-XMING-Raspberry-Pi.png" kasperskylab_antibanner="on"></p><p>(The above pic is the screenshot of Desktop of Raspberry Pi as seen in Xming)Now that we can graphically interact with Pi via our laptop, we want it to get connected to Internet via wifi USB Wifi adapter. So, we attached adapter to it through USB and connected it to our WiFi network.</p><p>If we want to stream a video in PC/mobile, we have to stream it through an ip address that can be accessible through the PC/mobile.</p><p>So we created HTML page interface for streaming. </p><p>Installed the Mjpeg app in Raspberry pi for video streaming from the web camera to a link on local server. Any device opening the address can view the live streaming on browser. Initially the quality was high and the frames per second was also good.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QacTCOlIXQzcUnaDsopfFBKDUOMp43u-kxB3g6yswjaYLj0SvKEr1N_yHtwNLB82kk5nCUdZJcNejPDrajA4HFepwsbgZFLHOXeZbP26L866oDyr3KEVjWk1NStCALYgFgIJWI8" width="297px;" height="326px;" style="border-style: none; border-width: initial; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); width: 221px;" kasperskylab_antibanner="on"></p>
