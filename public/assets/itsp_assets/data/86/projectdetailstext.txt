<p>Our projects basic aim was to make an home automated system(for door locks etc) which can be controlled using an android
mobile,laptop,or computer provided it has access to internet. In the first stage of the project, we completed the live video streaming part of the project through webiopi and controlling it through website with url as rpi,'s ip address and made interface through html coding so that we can get the live feed as soon as button is pressed .
In second stage we made all the bread board connections to be required by our project for successful running of our dc motor and connected to the respective gpio pin and learned controlling the gpio pin through internet to successfully activate the motor used in the door lock(basically a rack and pinion system) and opening/closing the door through internet directly using just on/two clicks to fully automate our door. Finally we installed the door locking gear system ,raspberry pi camera and door opening/closing system on a real life door and there was a fully automated door just in front of our eyes .</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Lets make the world a better place for living though automation</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>
