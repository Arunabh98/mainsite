<p>Basically our prooject consisted of the principles of working of raspberry pi board and raspberry pi camera , connections of the dc motor through bread board with gpio pins .           </p><p>our door locking system used the theory of gears and the interlocking property of their teeths to make a door lock operated using dc motor which is triggered using webiopi through buttons created through html coding . we are using the rack and pinion system to make a door lock with a rack gear interlocked with a 18 teeth gear attached to a motor so as to have a translational motion of the gear over the rack . so for the anticlockwise motion of the motor, the rack moves forward to lock the door . similarly for the clockwise rotation of the motor the rack moves in opposite direction to open the door lock .                                                                         </p><p>.we have connected the motors to the raspberry pi using the connection on the breadboard and an external power supply of two batteries of 12 volt and triggering the motor by activating just the right gpio pin using the button at the website having the link to activate the gpio pins </p><p>So our whole project is based on the theory of webiopi to control the gpio pins and supply power for running our camera and dc motors through complicated bread board connections</p>
