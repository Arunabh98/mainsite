<p>The
popularity of home automation has been increasing greatly in recent years due to much higher affordability
and simplicity through smartphone and tablet connectivity. The concept of the " Internet of Things " has tied in
closely with the popularization of home automation.Through the integration of information technologies with the
home environment, systems and appliances can communicate in an integrated manner which results in
convenience, energy efficiency, and safety benefits.</p><p>We had planned to make an entirely automated door equipped with camera, automatic lock and automatic system to open and close the door when triggered manually by the user using a website opened through a browser either using mobile,laptop or computer anywhere until it is connected through a wireless network or LAN,MAN or global area network and the person authorized has a password to access through the security barrier of the website. Basically we are using the functionalities provided by the raspberry pi board due to its capability of acting as a server and its compatibility towards raspberry pi camera makes it fully compatible for our project. our project basically consists of three subsections ;</p><p>----&gt; First is the live video streaming part which has been entrusted by the raspberry pi camera </p><p>----&gt; Second is the Door Locking system for which we used motors and gears for smooth locking and unlocking of doors</p><p>----&gt; Final section was the opening and closing of door which was done using wheels</p>
