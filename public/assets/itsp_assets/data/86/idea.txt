<p>Our project has been inhabited by three basic and root concepts for proper working of our project</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Concept behind the working of raspberry pi camera </span></p><p>Our Raspberry pi board had an empty slot for rpi camera which can be easily enabled using the configuration option in the Terminal window of the raspi when connected to a desktop using a HDMI to VGA cable and have used the properties of flask video streaming and webiopi to get a live video of the person standing outside the door . Basically , to enable the camera we just have to run a python program just to get the live video automatically on the start of the website with url as raspberry pi's ip address with a specific port ( for example : -0.0.0.0:5000 ) . we just commanded the raspberry pi to run the python program automatically at start or boot of raspberry pi using the configuration option and automatically run python program on boot</p><p><strong>Concept behind the locking of door</strong></p><p>Basically we have used the mechanical concept of gears and interlocking property of their teeths to make a door lock operated using dc motor which is triggered using webiopi through buttons created through html coding . we are using the rack and pinion system to make a door lock with a rack gear interlocked with a 18 teeth gear attached to a motor so as to have a translational motion of the gear over the rack . so for the anticlockwise motion of the motor, the rack moves forward to lock the door . similarly for the clockwise rotation of the motor the rack moves in opposite direction to open the door lock.we have connected the motors to the raspberry pi using the connection on the breadboard and an external power supply of two batteries of 12 volt and triggering the motor by activating just the right gpio pin using the button at the website having the link to activate the gpio pins</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Concept behind opening/closing of door</strong></p><p>Basically for opening and closing the door we are using the properties of wheel to use its rotation to take the door along with it about the hinges . the motors are controlled using the webiopi and the html programming is used to create the buttons on the website to control its rotation either clockwise or anticlockwise . we are using two motors with different rpms for smooth opening of door with motors fitted at different radius of curvatures . we have connected the motors to the raspberry pi using the connection on the breadboard and an external power supply of two batteries of 12 volt and triggering the motor by activating just the right gpio pin using the button at the website having the link to activate the pin 23 for open and pin 24 for close and pin 25 acting as a switch</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Basically our project of home automation is completely based on the webiopi and its functionalities to control different gpio pins on the raspberry pi board for operating the motor , camera using the url as the ip address of the raspberry pi with specific port and protected with password so as to make it easy for people and get an entirely automated door with live video, door lock , and door open/close</strong></p>
