<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Plan of Action:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Week 1:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">PLAN:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">One group starts learning Raspberry Pi and achieves basic usage</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">and internet communication using 2 Raspberry Pis. The second</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">group starts working on determining how to go about the mechanical system.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">DID:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Understand the various features of the raspberry pis as well as of OpenCV. Decided on the design for mechanics. Started understanding Sockets. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Week 2:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Should get a good grasp on how to use the Rasp Pis to relay</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">chess moves and how to make all possible chess moves</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">automatically in this week. Start work on image processing to be</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">able to read the state of the board.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">DID:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Got a good grasp of raspberry pi and started configuring it. Made a code for 2-player chess defining valid moves for each piece. Started working on sockets and flask. Went to buy the required mechanical and electrical products. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Week 3:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">PLAN:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Will do image processing in this week and complete the mechanical motion of the bot.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">DID:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mainly did mechanical work focusing on completing the box. Got a lot of problems in this process so most of the week went on finding a solution for each problem. Also, completed the motion of the motors. Could control the motors wirelessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Week 4:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Will start integrating the 3 modules i.e. image processing , motion of the bot and wireless communication into the main code</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">DID:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wrote the algorithm for image processing. Printed out a desired chessboard and checked image processing with it. Got problems related to mechanics again. Took some time to solve. Finished making the 3 modules work independently.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Week 5:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We will finish the integrating all the components and keep some time for debugging and testing</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">DID:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Iintegrated all the modules. Debugging was done of the main code. The wiring was made neat and final. Testing was done for some moves.</span></p></h3><ul>
