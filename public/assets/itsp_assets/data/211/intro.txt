<p>We had planned to make a chess bot which allows two players to play chess over the internet. The basic idea of the project was to that the first person plays a move on his board and this move is recognized using image processing and sent over the internet (using wi-fi) to the location of the second player. Then, that move is played automatically on his board and the game continues.</p>
