<p>A bipolar stepper motor has a pair of coils. Each coil forms two complementary pairs opposite each other. The current is passed through the pair of coils in such a way such that resultant magnetic field is continuously rotating. When a current is passed through the rotor , magnetic field is induced which tends to rotate the rotor in the direction of resultant magnetic field, thus making the motor rotate! <br><img width="234" height="215" src="file:///C:\Users\Yashraj\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml\wpsFDF2.tmp.png"></p><p>What Is a Socket?
</p><p>Normally, a server runs on a specific computer and has a socket that is bound to a specific port number. The server just waits, listening to the socket for a client to make a connection request.</p><p>On the client-side: The client knows the hostname of the machine on which the server is running and the port number on which the server is listening. To make a connection request, the client tries to rendezvous with the server on the server's machine and port. The client also needs to identify itself to the server so it binds to a local port number that it will use during this connection. This is usually assigned by the system.</p><p><img width="301" height="73" src="file:///C:\Users\Yashraj\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml\wps901E.tmp.png"></p><p>If everything goes well, the server accepts the connection. Upon acceptance, the server gets a new socket bound to the same local port and also has its remote endpoint set to the address and port of the client. It needs a new socket so that it can continue to listen to the original socket for connection requests while tending to the needs of the connected client.</p><p><img width="301" height="88" src="file:///C:\Users\Yashraj\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml\wps901F.tmp.png"></p><p>On the client side, if the connection is accepted, a socket is successfully created and the client can use the socket to communicate with the server.</p><p>The client and server can now communicate by writing to or reading from their sockets.</p><p><img width="624" height="2" src="file:///C:\Users\Yashraj\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml\wps9020.tmp.png"></p><p>Definition:</p><p>Asocketis one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.</p><p><img width="624" height="2" src="file:///C:\Users\Yashraj\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml\wps9021.tmp.png"></p><p>An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number. Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints. That way you can have multiple connections between your host and the server.</p>
