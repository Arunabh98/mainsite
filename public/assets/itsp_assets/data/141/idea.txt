<li>Electronic ducted fan: </li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">This is essentially a thrust generating device with an electrically driven propeller. The propeller is contained in a duct to contain the airflow and increase the thrust.The duct reduces losses in thrust from the tips of the props, and varying the cross-section of the duct allows the designer to advantageously affect the velocity and pressure of the airflow according to Bernoulli's Principle. Ducted fan propulsion is used in aircraft, airships, airboats, hovercraft and fan packs.By sizing the ductwork appropriately, one can adjust the air velocity through the fan to allow it to operate more efficiently at higher air speeds than a propeller would.</p><ul>
<li>Thrust increment:</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;"> Thrust depends on two things: the velocity of the exhaust gas and the mass of that gas.The afterburner increases thrust primarily by accelerating the exhaust gas to a higher velocity. While the mass of the fuel added to the exhaust does contribute to an increase in exhaust mass, this effect is small compared to the increase in exhaust velocity.The afterburner then injects fuel downstream of the turbine and reheats the gas. In conjunction with the added heat, the pressure rises in the tailpipe and the gas is ejected through the nozzle at a higher velocity.</p><div><ol>
