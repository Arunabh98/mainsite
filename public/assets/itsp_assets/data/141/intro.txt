<p>The basic idea of our project is to increase the thrust of an Electronic Ducted Fan(EDF) by burning fuel and accelerating the hot gases. We added a duct made of aluminium as an extension to the duct of the EDF, and the fuel is burnt inside this. The fuel being used is butane - which is easily available and highly combustible.</p>
