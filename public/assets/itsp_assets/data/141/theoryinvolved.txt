<li>Basics Of Afterburner     </li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The idea behind an afterburner is to inject fuel directly into the exhaust stream and burn it using the oxygen. This heats and expands the exhaust gases, and can increase the thrust of the EDF. An afterburner is nothing but a set of fuel injectors, a tube, a flame holder that makes sure the fuel doesn't burn out, and a nozzle. Since our afterburner operates at subsonic velocities, the exit nozzle is converging.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Conventionally, an afterburner is used in jet engines, where only about 50% of the oxygen is burnt because burning all the oxygen in the air flow would raise the temperature to very high values and the turbines cannot sustain such heat. So, the unburnt oxygen in the air stream is reacted with additional fuel down the line. This produces a significant increase in the thrust.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">We are making a sort of hybrid between jet engines and electrically driven motors. The flow from the EDF directly passes into the afterburner's duct where the fuel is burnt. Here, again to limit the temperature, we've made the fuel the limiting reagent.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The biggest disadvantage of an afterburner is its high fuel consumption rate and low efficiency. In addition to that, the pressure behind the EDF is not sufficiently high, leading to a further decrease in efficiency.</p>
