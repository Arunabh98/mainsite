		<li>Theoretical model</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">After deciding that our initial design of burning fuel behind an EDF wasn't feasible, we decided to make a sort of cross between a turbo-fan and a ramjet. The flow from the edf goes into two concentric cylinders, like in a turbo-fan engine. In the inner cylinder, there is a flame holder, a sparking rod and the fuel line. The fuel is burnt here. So, this part is essentially a ramjet. Part of the air flows through the inner cylinder while the rest of it goes via the concentric outer cylinder. The air flow through the outer cylinder serves to cool down the cylinder inside. The bypass ratio (ratio of flow rate through outer cylinder to that through the inner cylinder) was decided by rules of thumb. </p><ul>		<li>Measurement equipment

			<li>Thrust Measurement:</li>		</ul><ul>
		Initially, we thought of using spring balance to measure the thrust. However, we couldn't think of a way to do it without damaging the spring balance with the high temperature gases coming out of the rear end.
			<br>
		So, in order to measure the thrust, we made a frame out of aluminium and plywood (We also tried one made of plastic, however it could not withstand the shear forces generated by the EDF) which can hold the system in place with the flame and the high speed flow is directed in the vertically upward direction. When placed on a weighing machine and turned on, we can calculate the thrust that this arrangement can provide by subtracting the weight of the system from the displayed apparent weight.

	The fuel flow rate is controlled using a servo. We are using butane refill canisters as fuel sources. These cans are similar to deodorant cans. We have made a frame out of plywood to hold the can in place while a 15 kg-cm servo motor pushes it from behind and also simultaneously pulls it via a rope tied to the can that goes through a system of pulleys. We have a reasonably good control over the fuel flow rate with this system. The servo is controlled by an Arduino board and can receive input either from a laptop or a radio transmitter.

		<li>Combustion chamber and Flame holder
		<ul>
			<li>Flame Holder</li>		</ul></li>		<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
			The flame holder is a a circular piece of aluminium with a lot of holes symmetrically arranged around its centre. These holes are present for airflow. The central hole consists of a protruding steel rod and the copper tube between whom the spark is obtained.
		</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">
			Classically, the flame holder consists of a cylinder with some air holes in it to allow air to form an eddy. Currents of air moving through the engine swirl around the device, leaving a void in the middle where a flame can burn. As fuel is combusted, it elevates the air temperature around the flame holder. Rapidly heating air expands to generate thrust, while the high heat ignites incoming fuel to keep the engine continually running.
		</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">
			The flame holder became a problem towards the end because of the material it was made from i.e. aluminium. As the rest of the combustion chamber was made from stainless steel, the welding process became a problem. This was sorted out by us by welding together the two stainless steel parts of the combustion chamber by connecting steel rods and pressing the flame holder between them such that it was held by pressure and frictional forces.

		</p><li>Ignition system</li>	</ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">
		Out of the two options(i.e. the glow plug, the spark plug), we chose the spark plug. However, we did not use the spark plug bought from the market. We used the concept of sparking and modified a circuit directly obtained from an electric fly swatter and used it which sparked according to a signal from the arduino. The circuit was modified using a IC 7805, a MOSFET and an electric relay.
	</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">
		Sparking is caused by the electrical breakdown of air because of high voltage of 2500V between the ends of two conductors. The spark was obtained between a steel rod and the copper tube(carrying butane gas). The ignition of the butane gas is not instantaneous but requires a few seconds of continuous and rapid sparking to initiate the flame. The tricky thing about spark plugs are that it requires the two conducting ends to have an optimum distance between them for sparking to occur. Too close, it won't get hot enough. Too far, the electric field doesn't reach breakdown value. Hence, the sparking mechanism remained the most delicate part of the project.

		<li>Control software</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">We're controlling the EDF,servo and and the ignition system with an arduino. The arduino gets inputs from a radio frequency receiver, The whole system can be controlled wirelessly. The problem was that an arduino can read only analog signals and the receiver gave pulse width modulated signals, So we had to write the code to read pwm signals. Instead of continuously monitoring the values on the input pins, we decided to use the Interrupt Service Routine on the Arduino. But, since there are only two interrupt pins on Arduino Uno, we had to use pin change interrupts. </p><ul>		<li>EDF</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">We ordered the Electronic Ducted Fan online on HobbyKing. It's 70 mm in diameter, has 6 blades and provides a thrust of around 800g. It consumes a maximum current of 36A and requires a 4S LiPo to run it</p><ul>	</ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">
