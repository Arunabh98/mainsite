<li>Thrust Measurement:</li></ul><ul>Initially, we thought of using spring balance to measure the thrust. However, we couldn't think of a way to do it without damaging the spring balance with the high temperature gases coming out of the rear end.<br>So, in order to measure the thrust, we made a frame out of aluminium and plywood (We also tried one made of plastic, however it could not withstand the shear forces generated by the EDF) which can hold the system in place with the flame and the high speed flow is directed in the vertically upward direction. When placed on a weighing machine and turned on, we can calculate the thrust that this arrangement can provide by subtracting the weight of the system from the displayed apparent weight.</ul><ul>

We are using butane refill canisters as fuel sources. These cans are similar to deodorant cans. We have made a frame out of plywood to hold the can in place while a 15 kg-cm servo motor pushes it from behind and also simultaneously pulls it via a rope tied to the can that goes through a system of pulleys. We have a reasonably good control over the fuel flow rate with this system. The servo is controlled by an Arduino board and can receive input either from a laptop or a radio transmitter. </p><ul><li>Combustion chamber and Flame holder</li><li>Ignition system</li><li>Control software</li><li>EDF</li></ul>
