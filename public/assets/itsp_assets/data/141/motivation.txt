<p>As we try to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, most of our modes of transport will eventually switch to using renewable sources of energy. However, most of these renewable sources of energy cannot be used directly, and are converted to and stored as electrical energy.
Therefore, it is safe to assume that most of our modes of transport in the future, including our aircraft, will be powered by electricity. Unfortunately, electric motors by themselves are not yet powerful enough to power our aircraft. We believe we can use the EDF Afterburner as a bridge between conventional jet engines and the electric motors that will replace jet engines in the near future.</p>
