<p>The catastrophic rise in the crime rate and violence against women calls for an urgent solution. Self
defence being the best form of immediate protection in the event of a criminal attack, we have
designed PepperShield as a device that will provide a safeguard against the attacker, as also contact
emergency numbers for help.
Numerous victims of attempted rape, molestation or kidnapping refrain from filing an FIR or pursuing
a case against the criminal for lack of evidence. In order to help the victims feel fearless and bring the
perpetrators of the crime to justice, PepperShield provides a photograph of the crime suspect at the
moment of perpetrating the attack, thus preserving valuable evidence to identify and testify against
the attacker when a criminal case has been registered.</p><p>Pepper Shield has been designed keeping in mind that it should be easy to use so that any person without any prior technical knowledge may also be able to use it. Also it had to kept in mind that the device has a significant impact on the attacker so that the victim may get some time to escape. Also, since the device provides the co-ordinates of the place the victim has used the device, it enables faster response measures. Adding to these, we also had to keep in mind the actual cost of making the whole device as we have to make it financially viable for a regular person to purchase this device.</p>
