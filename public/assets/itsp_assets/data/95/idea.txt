button of the actual spray and has been so placed that pressing the spray also
presses the button switch and triggers the whole mechanism of the device. The

For setting up the AT command mode, the file HC_05.ino was uploaded to the Arduino board. Then after removing the USB port from the Arduino, the following connection was made with the HC-05 module and the Arduino.</p><p>Then the jumper connecting to the 5V of the Arduino was removed from the Arduino and the USB power supply was now given to the Arduino. Then the jumper was reconnected to the 5V port on the Arduino. The HC05 module was operating in the AT command mode (The AT mode can be checked by observing the red LED on the HC-05 switcing on for one second, after every 2 seconds).</p><p>The serial monitor is opened and to ensure the working of the module in AT mode, “AT” was typed in the serial monitor and a reply “OK” was observed. This ensures the proper functioning of the module in AT command mode.</p><p>To change the baud rate of the HC-05 (which by default is 9600) to our desired rate of 1382400, the command “AT+UART=1382400,1,0” was sent to the Arduino wherein the 1 represents the stop bit and 0 the parity bit.</p><p>Functioning-</p><p>For the device to be configured in the transparent data mode, the following connections are made as given in the figure provided. After this connection is made (it is preferable to use 3.3V from the Arduino to power the HC05 module as compared to the 5V) .The android device is to be turned on and the Bluetooth should be enabled. On searching for devices, this would appear by the name of “HC-05”. The password of the Bluetooth module as changed in the AT mode is to be entered into the android device to pair the device.</p><p>The initiation of the Bluetooth module will be through the android application. Our application has a button called “Enable Standby” and pressing that activates the HC05 device to start transmitting data (i.e; the image captured by the camera byte by byte).</p>
