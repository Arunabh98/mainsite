									VGA timing of the OV7670 camera module</h5>

										The image above shows the signals for a "VGA" (640 x 480) frame. During HSYNC high state, we must capture 640 pixels, equivalent to a line. The 480 lines, equivalent to a frame, are captured during the low state of VSYNC. This means that the falling edge of VSYNC signals the start of a frame, and its rising edge signals the end of a frame.
