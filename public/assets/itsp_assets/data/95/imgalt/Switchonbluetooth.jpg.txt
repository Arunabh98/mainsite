										On pressing the ‘Enable Standby’ button, the connection between the HC-05 and the android device is made and the android device can now start receiving data from the Bluetooth if the PepperShield has been used. If the Bluetooth of the android device is not yet switched on, then the app asks for the permission to turn that on and then proceed.
