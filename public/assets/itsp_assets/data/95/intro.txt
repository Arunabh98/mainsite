<p>PepperShield is an augmented pepper spray to be used as a device for self defence in the event of a criminal attack on the individual. While motivated by the need for a defence mechanism to counter the rapid rise in crimes against women, especially in India, it can also be used by any individual for protecting themselves or another person under the circumstances of a criminal attack. The device is provided with a camera which swiftly takes a picture of the attacker at the moment the deterrent spray is released. The device then sends the photograph to the victim’s cellphone via Bluetooth and this in turn triggers the sending of an SOS message to any preset emergency contact numbers. The message is sent along with the victim’s current location tracked through GPS.</p>
