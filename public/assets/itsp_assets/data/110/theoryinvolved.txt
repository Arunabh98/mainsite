<p>The cube can balance on its edge or its side using the principles of conservation of angular momentum. Once balanced, it will remain at the stable equilibrium position even in presence of external forces. This happens by producing torques to cancel out the external torques about the balance point. There will be wheels which will rotate with the required angular velocity. With the help of sensors, we will be able to analyze the real time position of the object and thus calculate the torque required to be given to the wheels to balance the body.</p><p><br>We will only be able to manipulate the rotation of the motor connected to the reaction wheel. Any torque produced by gravity about the pivot will be restored by the torque produced due to a reaction wheel.We derived the equations that govern the movements of both the reaction wheel and the frame in terms of the properties of the frame and the wheel.</p>
