<p>Room automation is a fast growing field because of our need for automating as many things as possible. Currently, most of the systems have an app or a webpage through which appliances can be controlled. In this project, we wanted to make it truly automatic by sensing the current conditions while allowing users to go back to manual or app based control if they are not comfortable with the auto mode or even tweak the auto mode to better suit their needs.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
