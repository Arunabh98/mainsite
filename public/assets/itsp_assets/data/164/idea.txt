The solar cells capture the light energy, usually from the sun-rays, and convert them into electrical energy by using the property of photo-electric effect. We had initially planned to assemble a solar panel ourselves but later realized that it demands a fully-clean room and sensitive handling as the solar cells extremely delicate in nature. </p><iframe width="854" height="510" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrGIj8P9Ys8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Water Pumping System : </strong></span></div>
