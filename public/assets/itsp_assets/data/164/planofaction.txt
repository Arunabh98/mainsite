<h3>Week 1 (May 18th -24th)</h3><ul>
	</ul><ul>
<li>What we have planned ?<br>
<ul>
<li>To do research on solar cells and solar panels for better understanding of them. Improved the project idea to wireless control of the motor.</li></ul></li><li>What we have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Got some information about the solar panels and a clear plan of what we need in the project.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Week 2 (May 25th- 31st )</p><ul>
	
<li>What we have planned ?<br><ul>
		
<li>To acquire a perfect idea about solar panels.</li>		
<li>Learn about various relays and other electronic components.</li>	</ul></li>	
<li>What we have accomplished?
	
<ul>
		
		
<li>Researched on how to enhance voltage using relays.</li><li>Discussed the idea of making a solar panel by assembling solar cells in series among the team members.</li>	</ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (June 1st - 7th)</h3><ul>
	
<li>What we have planned ?<ul>
		
<li>To make an impeller design using solid works.</li>		
<li>To get the required components to make a solar panel.</li>	</ul></li></ul><ul>
	
<li>What we have accomplished ?<ul>
		
<li>After consulting a member of Solar Module Laboratory, IIT Bombay, we had to step back on making a solar panel as solar cells are very sensitive to handle and they require a fully clean room.</li><li>Made a design of impeller with rough parameters.</li>	</ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (June 8th - June 14th)</h3><ul>
	
<li>What we have planned ?
	
<ul>
		
<li>To design the circuit for controlling the motor without bluetooth.</li>		
<li>Outer structure of the water pump.</li>	</ul></li>	
<li>What we have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Made a design of pumping system using solid works.</li><li>Verified the circuit connections and controlled without using bluetooth.</li></ul></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 60px;"></p><h3>Week 5 (June 15th - June 21st)</h3><ul>
	
<li>What we have planned ?
	
<ul>
		
<li>To build circuit comprising solar panel, battery, charge controller and the motor including bluetooth module.</li><li>Look for appropriate materials to build the motor pump structure.</li>	</ul></li></ul><ul>
	
<li>What we have accomplished?
	
<ul>
		
<li>Successfully completed the circuit and operated motor using android app through bluetooth.</li><li>Decided to make the motor structure out of house-hold materials.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 22nd - June 28th)</h3><ul><li>What we have planned ?<ul><li>To complete the motor structure</li><li>To run practical tests</li></ul></li><li>What we have accomplished ?<ul><li>Prepared the motor structure but it suffered damage accidentally.</li><li>Had to make-do with another small size structure.</li><li>Successfully checked the test conditions.</li></ul></li></ul><h3></h3>
