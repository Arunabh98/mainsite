<div>The centrifugal pump works in the same way as sucking on the straw. As the engine starts, the impeller turns which forces the water around it out of the pump's discharge port. The partial vacuum created, allows the earth's air pressure to force water up the suction hose (straw), and into the suction (inlet) side of the pump to replace the displaced water. When the water hits the rotating impeller, energy of the impeller is transferred to the water, forcing the water out (centrifugal force). The water is displaced outward, and more water can now enter the suction side of the pump to replace the displaced water.<br></div><div><p><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B4w0_fgiw_nNRmtVSTd0UHluWDQ"></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Solar Power System : </span></strong></p><p><inline style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semi-conducting materials.
Electrons (negatively charged) are knocked loose from their atoms as they are excited. Due to the special chemical composition of solar cells, the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction. The chemical bonds of the material are vital for the process to work, and often silicon, bonded with boron or phosphorus is used in different layers.
An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity.<br></inline></p><p><inline style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></inline></p><p><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B4w0_fgiw_nNbmpmNUJkR2NjQ3M"></p></div>
