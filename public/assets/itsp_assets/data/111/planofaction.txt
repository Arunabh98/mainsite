<h3>Week 1 (May 5th-11th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">To study about the project and it's base we were making (i.e. to study about the hovercraft and quad copter).</p><ul>
<li>Accomplished
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Understood the mechanisms and the theories involved in making of hovercraft and quad copter. </p></li></ul><h3></h3><h3>Week 2 (May 11th-16th )</h3><ul><li>Planned
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">To create a design which is fit for the problem statement with which we have come forth for the project.</p></li></ul><ul>
<li>Accomplished
<ul>
</ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">We crated a design which would be good during it's flight time.</p></li></ul><h3></h3><h3>Review Meet - 1(May 17th)</h3><p>Came to know that the design and the project we have chosen has many difficulties like:-</p><ol><li>Weight Issue - The weight would be much more than that off hovercraft which would be requiring high kv motor.</li><li>Landing Issue - During its landing from the sky the hovercraft may break off.</li><li>Torque Issue - If the C.O.M. of the hovercraft and the C.O.M. of the quad copter aren't placed correctly then there would be torque effect about it's center.</li></ol><h3>Week 3 (May 18th-23rd)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>We researched a alternative way of our project such that our project statement and to understand about it in detail.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>What we achieved ?<ul><li>We found a alternate with the help of mentor and manager of our club, that is hydrofoam which fits our problem statement perfectly.</li><li>We didn't got the enough time to go in depth about the project.</li><li>We ordered the electrical things needed from the online website (Hobby-King).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 24th-30th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?
<ul>
<li>Need to completely understand about the hydro-foam.</li><li>To start making the parts needed to build the hydrofoam.</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Came to completely know about the hydro-foam.</li><li>Got the Styrofoam sheet from the market.</li><li>Made the parts out of the Styrofoam for it.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Review Meet - 2(May 31st)</h3><p>We discussed about the project with rest of the teams, and cleared their doubts which they had about our project.<br>It went excellently and gave us a hope hat we could do it within the required time.</p><h3>Week 5 (June 1st-6th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?
<ul>
<li>To order the remaining components and to making it flowing with ease.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>We have ordered the remaining things with the help of our manager on online.</li><li>We have made the parts perfect to the shape such that they would fit into one other when once the remaining parts arrive.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 7th-15th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned for ?<br><ul><li>We have planned for completing the construction of the project by Tuesday and making the first take off on Wednesday.</li><li>After the first take off ends, need to make the necessary final adjustments so that it would fly with ease.</li></ul></li><li>What we have accomplished in ?<br><ul><li>Worked very hard without losing hope and eager to finish the project.</li><li>Finished the project sucessfully.</li></ul></li></ul>
