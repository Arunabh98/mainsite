for this vehicle to make lift o and land on. The speed could be
improved more by using the dual-propeller motor system. We
could also reduce the weight and drift of the system. We could
also improve the thrust versus weight ratio by two motor system.
We could use Depron or lightweight-plastic material instead of
Styrofoam. The energy needed for this system is more compared
to the future-thought system.</p><p>We sincerely thank S.T.A.B. for letting us to do the project
with the idea we came front. I also thank all my mentors and
other related members of I.T.S.P. for understanding our idea
and we all hope that it would be a great success by completing
and presenting the project and hope that other team in the mere
future would develop it and take it to an higher level. </p>
