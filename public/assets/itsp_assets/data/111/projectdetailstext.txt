<p>During the starting phase of the project my team and me were very enthusiastic about the solving of the problem statement we had in our minds. We went through the way of solving it and came with an idea of combining the hovercraft and the quad-copter. We highly researched on it and made a good design which would possibly be existing in the future but nearly after the two weeks of the start of slots with the guidance of the mentors and manager we came to know that the desired bot couldn't able to land and the weight would be too heavy to fly it. We didn't lost our hope and went forward to look up a solution.</p><p>Then we came with the other solution of the Hydro-foam which matched with our problem statement and thought would be best of making in this summer. Though with three weeks remained we researched on the hydrofoam and by the end of last two weeks we ordered the products through online as it was highly unavailable in the market but due to over rotten luck we got the shipment late, but we went through difficulties without losing hope and enthusiasm to finish it.</p>
