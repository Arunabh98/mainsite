	As stated above, our dream of this project was to build a
RC-vehicle which could move on any surfaces like grass, plain
road, concrete surface, water, ice, etc. and also can fly in the
air like a plane.</p><p>

and Quadcopter but after going through the concept of other we
thought that the hydrofoam would suit our project statement for
the best of anyone.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfGD9se32MI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfGD9se32MI</a></p>
