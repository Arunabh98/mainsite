<p> The theory involved in designing of this project are:-</p><p>Forward motion-</p><p>The motion of the prototype on ground or water is due to the thrust provided by air flow caused due to rotation of propeller in the front.</p><p>The forward motion is boosted by following two factors</p><p>1) There are 4 carbon sheet pieces attached to the prototype where it contacts the surface. These carbon sheets have very little friction which helps in forward motion of protoype.</p><p>2)The shape and aero dynamics of the bot are in away such that the air flow due to propeller motion creates high pressure above the bot than below which gives a small lift to the bot so that it can easily move forward. The shape and little weight of the bot makes this easy to happen.</p><p>Take off and Landing-</p><p>During the forward motion of the bot if we move the elevators upward . There will be an obstruction to air flow above the bot which applies pressure on elevators . To balance this there will be torque applied on the front part of the bot which  rotates its direction upwards providing the required angle of attack. Landing is also done in a similar way. Smooth takeoff and landing is done by controlling the angle of elevators .</p><p>Change of direction -</p><p>due to the rudders which are attached at the back</p><p>Aerdynamic Lift:-</p><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Airfoil_lift_and_drag.jpg" style="width: 426px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">lt is also know as hydrodynamic force and is purely based on Bernoulli's principle. Bernoulli's principle states that that for an low-viscous flow of a non conducting fluid, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in thefluid's potential energy.<br>According to Bernoulli's Principle, the air passing over the top of an aerofoil or wing must travel further and hence faster that air the travelling the shorter distance under the wing in the same period but the energy associated with the air must remain the constant at all times. The consequence of this is that the air above the wing has a lower pressure than the air below below the wing and this pressure difference creates the lift.<br>For further clarity in the concept Newton also explained the Bernoulli's theory based on his Third Law of Motion.</p><p><img src="http://www.mpoweruk.com/images/Lift%20by%20Newton.gif"></p>
