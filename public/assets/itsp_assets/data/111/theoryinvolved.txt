<p>The principle involved in this system is very simple. The air moving with high
velocity is passed from above the big base part and the ends are fexibly movable
so that the air can be shaped up, down, left or rightwards.</p><p><img src="http://uscaero77.free.fr/_avion/hyfo/hyfob8.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>If the rudders are moved towards the right(/left) side, the air hits the rudders normal to the left(/right) direction creating the back side of the part to move towards the left side, then the whole RC-vehicle will tend to move towards the right(/left) side. </li><li>If the elevators are moved downward(/upwards), the air hits the elevators in the upwards(/downwards) which makes the back part to gain more force in the downward(/upward) making the front part to go up(/down) which in-turn makes the RC-vehicle to lift off(/land on). </li><li>Initially it is connected to the receiver so that all the servos would restore to their normal length. Then we would keep it on the surface so that only the carbon plates touch the ground but not Depron(/Styrofoam) then the speed is slowly raised up and when a sucient good speed is attained by the RC-vehicle then the elevators are moved down so that the bot could attain the lift-off condition.</li><li>Once the RC-vehicle attains a good height in air, could be able to do the stunts with the help of rudder and dual-elevator system. We could fly if in air and when the battery needs to be recharged or when we want to end the ride the the elevators are pushed upwards, same as the method of the airplane so that the land on condition takes place perfectly without any rotten results.</li></ul><p><img src="http://aviationmiscmanuals.tpub.com/TM-1-1500-204-23-1/img/TM-1-1500-204-23-1_141_0.jpg" style="width: 828px;"></p><ul><li>The speeding and slowing down of the RC-vehicle depends on the transmitter which gives the information to E.S.C. about controlling the speed of the propeller- motor by absorbing the required voltage needed for the system to keep going.</li></ul>
