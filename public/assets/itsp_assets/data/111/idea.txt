<p>We evolved to the concept from the motivation of the RC plane.We need to move the prototype on the ground so we need two arms like basically we combined two RC planes.It has four elevators to provide the required upward lift and two rudders to change the direction.Rudders are controlled with a single servo using a bi arm servo head.The four elevators are controlled by two servos each servo managing two elevators which are attached vertically. It has three machines in one: it is a powerful radio controlled speedboat. It can be used on land  as well as it's main function: it moves on the ground with the help of the carbon sheets attached at the bottom of the prototype.The material which we used to build it is Styrofoam. The plane uses a powerful electric brushless motor (called screamer) and lipo battery. The planes is light and powerful enough to let this amazing machine fly and do all stunts. Besides Styrofoam we could also use depron to increase the strength.The image below gives the clear idea of the concept of rudders and elevators.The elevators(horizontal flaps) which are one above the are connected with a carbon rod so that it acts as a single elevator.So on the whole we have two independent elevators which are made out of four flaps.The independent elevators are helpful for performing the stunts.</p><p>The image below shows the Bi arm concept of the plane which helps for its movement on the ground providing the required balance.</p><p><img src="http://uscaero77.free.fr/_avion/hyfo/hyfob5.jpg"></p><p>The image below gives the clear idea of the concept of rudders and elevators.The elevators(horizontal flaps) which are one above the are connected with a carbon rod so that it acts as a single elevator.So on the whole we have two independent elevators which are made out of four flaps.The independent elevators are helpful for performing the stunts.</p><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6W39NKlTM8"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6W39NKlTM8</a></p><ol>
