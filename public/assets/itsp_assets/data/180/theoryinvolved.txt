<p>Our home automation project involves a switchboard which is connected to an Arduino and has manual switches on it too. The Arduino has a Bluetooth Module as well as an Ethernet Shield connected to it, which are necessary for the wireless methods of communication to the Android App. Our app has an option, for the mediu of connections, giving options to connect via Bluetooth or Internet.<br><br>The switchboard circuit part of the system is connected to the Arduino. There are relays, which are connected to the AC circiut, ie, the electrical devices, whose input changes are controlled by the Arduino. The Arduino receives commands from the Android App and forwards it to the relays, which changes the input state of the devices.</p><p><br>Also, we have inluded a button for functioning along with the Arduino, for manual control of the switches. However, this leads to a confusion between the state of switches registered in the app and the actual states. For this, we have included a feedback system, which continuously sends message from the Arduino to the App, updating the status of each and every switch continuously</p><p>For Voice Processing, we have included the Google Voice toolbar in our App, which takes the voice input when the button is tapped. It then sends this to the google server for conversion to string format, and can then be used directly in place of our switches.</p>
