<h3>Week 1 (May 6th -12th)</h3><p>&gt;Bought raspberry pi and webcam.</p><p>&gt;We set up the raspberry pi.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">        </p><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><p>&gt;Discussed various algorithms for converting .txt files in braille code </p><p>&gt;Discussed the mechanical design for braille display</p><p>&gt;Downloaded various required softwares like putty.exe,opencv and xming</p><p>&gt;Work allotted to team mates </p><p>&gt;Discussed the softwares to be used to convert the image captured into text.</p><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><p>&gt;learnt python and image processing as required by our project.</p><p>&gt;decided to use electromagnet as actuator after evaluating different options.</p><p>&gt;installed tesseract library for converting image to text.</p><p>&gt;designed the camera assembly.</p><p>&gt;coding started in python and open cv</p><p>&gt;designed first prototype .</p><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><p>&gt;made first prototype using laser cutting on acylic sheet.</p><p>&gt;we found a fault in our design due to which the prototype was not successful.</p><p>&gt;design was changed and cad of new design was completed using AUTODESK INVENTOR.</p><p>&gt;coding completed and we were able to take pictures using code in open cv.</p><p>&gt;we tested our code using 6 LEDS as one braille cell and it worked fine.</p><p>&gt;our python code was able to convert text into braille code.</p><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><p>&gt;we sent our modified drawings for laser cutting.</p><p>&gt;electronic part of project was completed.</p><p>&gt;we checked our code with stepper motor and electromagnets.</p><p>&gt;we were able to stitch two images using oopen cv.</p><p>&gt;camera assembly was completed.</p><h3>Week 6 (june 9th -june 15th)</h3><p>&gt;All the mechanical components were made.</p><p>&gt;some minor errors in code were fixed.</p><p>&gt;assembly of braille display almost completed.</p>
