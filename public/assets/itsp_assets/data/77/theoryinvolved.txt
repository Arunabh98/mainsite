<li>The chess engine uses negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruining to determine the best possible move with a recursive depth of 5.<ul><li>Negamax<strong> </strong>search is a variant form of minimax search that relies on the zero sum property of a two player game.</li><li><strong>Alpha–beta pruning</strong> is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games. It stops completely evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.</li><li>NegaMax operates on the same game trees as those used with the minimax search algorithm. Each node and root node in the tree are game states (such as game board configuration) of a two player game. Transitions to child nodes represent moves available to a player who's about to play from a given node.The negamax search objective is to find the node score value for the player who is playing at the root node.The root node inherits its score from one of its immediate child nodes. The child node that ultimately sets the root node's best score also represents the best move to play. Alpha-beta pruning can decrease the number of nodes the negamax algorithm evaluates in a search tree.Alpha (α) and beta (β) represent lower and upper bounds for child node values at a given tree depth. Negamax sets the arguments α and β for the root node to the lowest and highest values possible.When negamax encounters a child node value outside an alpha/beta range, the negamax search cuts off (<em>break</em> statement in the pseudocode) thereby pruning portions of the game tree from exploration. Cut offs are implicit based on the node return value, <em>bestValue</em>. A node value found within the range of its initial α and β is the node's exact (or true) value. This value is identical to the result the negamax base algorithm would return, without cut offs and without any α and β bounds. If a node return value is out of range, then the value represents an upper (if value ≤ α) or lower (if value ≥ β) bound for the node's exact value. Alpha-beta pruning eventually discards any value bound results. Such values do not contribute nor affect the negamax value at its root node.</li></ul></li></ul>
