<li>A code for single player chess using negamax with alpha beta pruning along with the help of transposition tables. Briefly speaking Negamax algorithm is a variant form of minimax algorithm. This algorithm relies on the fact that <em>max(a, b) = −min(−a, −b)</em> to simplify the implementation of the minimax algorithm.Minimax is a decision rule for <em>minimising</em> the possible loss for a worst case (<em>max</em>imum loss) scenario.</li></ul></li><li>voice recognition<ul><li>We are using voice recognition module version 3 for this purpose.It would be linked with Arduino.</li><li>It is used to take input from the user for example if he wants to move the coin from b8 to c6 he has to speak this "b 8 c 6" or he can undo a move by saying undo.</li></ul></li><li>Mechanical System<ul><li>This bot will be made of 2 stepper motors, 1 servo, 2 magnets and a wooden frame.</li><li>The motion in x and y direction are driven by stepper motors with the help rack and pinion.</li></ul></li><li>Electrical Part<ul><li>The stepper motors and servo are controlled with Arduino with the help of L293D.</li><li>The power supply required for Arduino is from the computer through USB cable and for the motors is through ac to dc convertor</li></ul></li><li>Arduino<ul><li>We are using the Arduino programming to interface and control our bot.</li><li>The Arduino code runs the motors which in turn moves the coins on the board.</li><li>It takes input from computer through Gobetwino and from user through voice recognition module and moves the motors respectively.</li></ul></li><li>Gobetwino<br><ul><li>Gobetwino is a Windows-based program that acts as an interface for the Arduino.</li></ul></li></ul>
