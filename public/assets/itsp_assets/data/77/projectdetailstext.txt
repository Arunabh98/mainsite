<p>First we started with searching for suitable components and simultaneously one of us was coding the chess engine. We decided that we'll be using rack and pinion mechanism, stepper motors and a servo. Stepper motors have better accuracy compared to regular dc motors. So we chose stepper motors but we were not sure whether they could provide enough torque. After testing we stuck with our initial choice of stepper motors. We chose Arduino Uno to control the 2 stepper motors and the servo. Coming to voice recognition we had two choices, use a voice recognition module or use the laptop itself. We thought VR module would be better because in future if we want to remove the laptop from the picture and run the c++ code somewhere else even then we'll have the voice recognition part of this project intact. We even read that the accuracy of voice recognition module is very good.We built a basic framework of the bot (consisting of the wooden base, telescopic channels and 2 sets of rack and pinions attached to them). Chess AI was coded by then. We bought all the required components and started adding them one by one. We also started coding for the voice recognition.But there was a problem with VR module. Its accuracy was very low when recognising similar sounding letter ( 'b' &amp; 'd' ; 'c' &amp; 'e' ).So we'll be changing the naming of grid from (a-h)(1-8) to (1-8)(1-8).</p>
