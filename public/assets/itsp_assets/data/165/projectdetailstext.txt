<p>Initially we decided to use Ardui-Pilot. The main reasons were it is more smooth over KK 2.1, it have many in built sensors, don't need to buy extra arduino board and more user friendly too. But in the 1st review meet mentors decided not to use Ardui-pilot we have to move on to Arduino + KK 2.1 flight controller board.</p><p>Started learning Arduino coding stuff. </p><p style="margin-left: 260px;">                                                                      <span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125); background-color: rgb(250, 192, 143);">FINALISING THE QUAD-COPTER COMPONENTS :</span></p><p>Choosing the FRAME -</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">With the mentors advise we got to know that the ease of controlling Quad-Copter decreases with increasing arm length. And also the vibrations can be minimized by the holes on the arm.</p><p>Choosing the MOTOR -</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Choosing the appropriate motor depends on mainly two factors the kv value and the max. current .</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Practically kv value is the rpm/volt when No load is applied.</p><p>And the max. current the motor draws.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Normally 600 ~1200 kv brushless motors are used for multi-rotor. We have selected 1100 kv - max. current ~15A</p><p>Choosing the ESC -</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The main criteria to select ESC is it's cont current value.It  should be greater than the max. current value of motor.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">We selected the ESC of cont current value 20A ( &gt;15A ).</p><p>Choosing the BATTERY - </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Choosing the battery also depends on the max. current value of motor. For that we have to see value DISCHARGE , CAPACITY and VOLTAGE. Apart from this we have to consider the weight of it.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The value of (mAh value*discharge) should be greater than the number of motors times the maximum current can be draw.</p><p>In this way we selected our components.</p><p style="margin-left: 260px;">                                                                  <span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125); background-color: rgb(250, 192, 143);">ASSEMBLING THE COMPONENTS &amp; CONNECTIONS :</span></p><p>After getting quadcopter components we went tinkerers lab, there we assembled the four arms of quad copter.Then there came the interesting part ...now we have to fix brushless motors on each arm which we did effortlessly. but then we wanted to fix electronic speed controller(ESC) on each arm, which was a major pain for us as the wires of ESC were to long and they were not soldered so we soldered the ESC wires with golden connectors and further we connected these golden connectors with motors and power distribution board(PDB).</p><p>Still we were having another pain after connecting ESCs with motors and PDB,and that was to wrap ESC over Quadcopter arm as the ESC wires were as longer as the quadcopter arm and we have to wrap those wires in such a way that these wires will not interfare with propeller or ultrasonic sensor. But somehow we managed to do so with the help of nylon tie.Then as per our mentors suggestion we insulated each golden connector in order to avoid short-circuit.Thus in this way we were able to wrap ESCs over quadcopter arms and connect them to motors and PDB.</p><p style="margin-left: 80px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 300px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(250, 192, 143);">MANAGING THE POSITIONS OF COMPNENTS :</span></p><p>So here another major task was to fix the positions of ultrasonic sensor,PDB, Arduino board,Flight controller board and Battery in very small area.As per demand of code, the major task was to read Altitude and thus it was necessary to fix ultrasonic sensor at bottom along with PDB. Also we fixed KK 2.1 at top and as we know Battery is the most heavy component among all components. Thus in order to avoid toppling of Quadcopter we wanted to fix it at centre. Thus we fixed battery between PDB and KK2.1. Then we  fixed Arduino board to the side of battery.</p><p>So after all connections and fixing the components another problem rose in front of us as the arms of quad-copter were not touching to ground instead of them Ultrasonic sensor was touching to ground. Thus we wanted to think on different alternative for landing. So we attached for spongy balls to the four arms of quad-copter exactly below the motor.Advantage of using sponge ball was it was helpful in fluent landing and was keeping ultrasonic sensor at sufficient height from ground.</p>
