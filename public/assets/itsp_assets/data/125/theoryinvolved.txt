<h3>Multirotor Coordinate System</h3><p>While discussing multirotor construction and piloting, it will certainly be useful to have a way of communicating different movements of the multirotor. Fortunately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles">mathematicians way back in the 1700s</a> came up with a way of describing the orientation of rigid bodies in space. The system they developed uses a set of three angles to describe, in this case, the orientation of the multirotor around the three spacial dimensions. You have probably heard of these angles before, they are called <strong>roll, pitch, and yaw</strong>.</p></li><li>The roll angle of the multirotor describes how the craft is tilted side to side. Rotation about the roll axis is like tilting your head towards one of your shoulders. Rolling the multirotor causes it to move sideways.</li><li>The pitch angle of the multirotor describes how the craft is tilted forwards or backwards. Rotation about the pitch axis is like tilting your head in order to look up or down. Pitching the multirotor causes it to move forwards or backwards.</li><li>The yaw angle of the multirotor describes its bearing, or, in other words, rotation of the craft as it stays level to the ground. Rotation about the yaw axis is like when you shake your head to say “no.</li></ul><p>                                                                                                <img src="http://blacktieaerial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/roll-pitch-yaw-angles-300x200.jpg" alt="roll pitch yaw angles"></p><ul><li>
<h3><strong>The Physics of Quadcopter Flight</strong></h3><h4>Steering</h4><p>While flying your multirotor, it is very important to understand how the multirotor moves and how we control it. At the root of all the multirotor’s movements is the rotational speed of the motors. By adjusting the relative speeds of the motors in just the right ways, keeping in mind that the rotational speed of the motors determines how much lift each prop produces, the flight controller is able to cause the multirotor to rotate around any of the directional axes (roll, pitch, and yaw), or make the multirotor gain or lose altitude.</p><h5>Roll and Pitch</h5><p>To make the multirotor rotate about the roll or pitch axes, the flight controller makes the motors on one side of the multirotor spin faster than the motors on the other side. This means that one side of the multirotor will have more lift than the other side, causing the multirotor to tilt.<br>So, for example, to make a quadcopter roll right (or rotate about the roll axis clockwise), the flight controller will make the two motors on the left side of the multirotor spin faster than the two motors on the right side. The left side of the craft will then have more lift than the right side, which causes the multirotor to tilt.<br>Similarly, to make a quadcopter pitch down (rotate about the pitch axis clockwise) the flight controller will make the two motors on the back of the craft spin faster than the two motors on the front. This makes the craft tilt in the same way that your head tilts when you look down.</p></li><li>The same principles apply for multirotors with more than four motors as well.</li><li>
<h5>Yaw</h5><p>Controlling the multirotor’s rotation about the yaw axis is a bit more complex than controlling its rotation about the roll or pitch axes. First, let’s discuss how we <em>prevent</em> rotation about the yaw axis. When assembling and programming multirotors, we set up the motors so that each motor spins in the opposite direction than its neighbors. In other words, using a quadcopter as an example again, starting from the front-left motor and moving around the multirotor clockwise, the motors’ rotational directions alternate, CW, CCW, CW, CCW. We use this rotational configuration to neutralize, or cancel out, each motor’s tendency to make the multirotor rotate.</p></li></ul><p>                              <img src="http://blacktieaerial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rotor-spin-roll-right-300x200.jpg" alt="rotor spin roll right">                                                 <img src="http://blacktieaerial.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rotor-spin-pitch-down-300x200.jpg" alt="rotor spin pitch down"></p><ul><li>
<h4><strong>Altitude Control</strong></h4></li><li>To make the multirotor hover, which means the multirotor stays at a constant altitude without rotating in any direction, a balance of forces is needed. The flight controller will need to counteract the force of gravity with the lift produced by the rotors.<br>Throwing a bit of math into the picture now, the force of gravity acting on the multirotor is equal to the mass of the multirotor times gravitational acceleration (which, as far as we are concerned, is a constant as long as we are staying on Earth). The lift produced by the multirotor is equal to the sum of the lift produced by each of the its rotors. Therefore, if the force of gravity equals the force of the lift produced by the motors, the multirotor will maintain a constant altitude.<br>To ascend or descend, therefore, the flight controller disrupts this balance. If the lift produced by the multirotor is greater than the force of gravity, the craft will gain altitude. If the opposite is true, that is, if the lift produced by the multirotor is less than the force of gravity acting on the multirotor, then the multirotor will fall.</li><li>
<h4><strong>Movement</strong></h4><p>So we’ve already discussed how, by adjusting the relative speeds of the motors, the flight controller can make the multirotor tilt. Well, the reason we want to be able to tilt the multirotor is that tilting the multirotor causes it to move. By tilting the multirotor in different directions, it can be made to move forward, backward, left, or right (neither altitude control nor yaw control involve tilting). For example, when the multirotor pitches down (clockwise around the pitch axis) it moves forward.<br>The reason the multirotor moves when it tilts is because while the multirotor is tilting, some of the lift produced by the rotor is directed horizontally while normally all of the lift is directed downward. This sideways component of the lift pushes the multirotor.</p></li><li>You can find all the details regarding quad-copter <a href="http://andrew.gibiansky.com/downloads/pdf/Quadcopter%20Dynamics,%20Simulation,%20and%20Control.pdf">here</a>.

flight orientation (up, down, backwards, forwards, left, right, yaw).</li><li>Next major component we used was the flight controller board .
