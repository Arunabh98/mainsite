The basic idea of the project was to design a quadcopter such a way that it will avoid any obstacle whether it be dynamic or static.What we did is simply disconnected two receiver channels(<em style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">i.e. aileron and elevator </em>)  and signalled them using arduino which receives the information about obstacle using IR sensors.In this age where every operation needs to be quick and to track places which are not easily accessible ,the quadcopter designed by us will suffice all these needs  will prove to be a  great asset in carious fields.</p></h5>
