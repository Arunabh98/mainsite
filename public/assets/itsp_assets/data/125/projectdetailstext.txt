<p>First we started planning  about this project and wanted to make a quadcopter that could travel from one fixed destination to other fixed destination and automatically avoid obstacles that comes in its way.But unfortunately due to lack of time and resources we felt we wont be able to complete that so we decided to make a quadcopter that could just avoid obstacles.</p><p>So in the beginning we ordered 4 IR sensors and an ardiuno mini and we practised it with a quadcopter which made previously by our senior.After we were successful in coding and our obstacle detection mechanism started working properly we ordered our parts for our quadcopter and meanwhile we were trying to improve the code and tried to make it  more stable.After the parts we arrived we assembled it completely within a day and our quadcopter was ready for flight.</p><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1tFDXKCtZQDgCu2GxMQZKKMo_8U-mMHw_XA" style="width: 498px;"></p><p>First we checked whether our quadcopter was working normally or not.For that we made all normal connections and we were successful.Then we came to the main part of our project where we were going to include obstacle detecting mechanism.So what we did is we added ardiuno channels 9 and 10 ir sensors thus we just kept the throttle to be controlled manually and the rest movements were decided by the obstacle.</p><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=156-RKnZD5fqBpF8QRqirDCWSHvQyAXEQbg"></p><p>At first we faced certain difficulties like keeping the quadcopter stable after take off.We just made connections more tight and neat and also tried to make our quadcopter little shock absorbent so that it could survive crashes during our test runs.</p><p>So after lot of test runs and improvement in our codes we finally were able to complete our project  in time and our  final quadcopter is  ready to fly.</p><p>All team members worked enthusiastically and divided our work .Also we were helped by Raj Mandoli for helping us getting the parts and during test flights.</p>
