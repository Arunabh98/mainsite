<h5>Ever since we saw  <a href="https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2014/6d1893c2059f3eda04a13d6bda68a553f7760148ffc92ff3c97f30725ef1b195" style="font-size: 14px;">Fly bot</a> we wanted to make one for our project .But  it needed a lot of research and hefty coding skills .So due to lack of idea and time constraints we left it and moved to simple obstacle avoidance system.Again we found a <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/arduimu-quadcopter-part-iii" style="font-size: 14px;">project</a></h5><h5>and we found it amazing and idle for our project  . We know that it is ArduIMU Quadcopter which is the older version of APM but still according to me ArduIMU is pretty expensive for students like us :( .So we decided to make some changes instead and continue our project .</h5><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=15jOSw6ZKxt19xVE1UVauTio2JfC9TkTTDA" alt=""></p><h5>
	Also major motivation behind this project was that we felt a need to create a bot which could  easily go  in areas where physically going is not possible and we should be able to easily track and study these places using our bot.So we  decided to prepare a basic obstacle avoiding mechanism which upon further modifications could be used in various fields and can prove to be a great asset for studies and research.</h5><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3FyJZbtSBk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
