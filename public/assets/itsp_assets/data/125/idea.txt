<p>So the major  components involved in this project are :-</p><p>1.) Flight Control Board( KK 2.1.5): This board helps to stabilise the plane. It  consist
of v2 flat sensors : 3 accels,3 gyros,3 magnetometers  attached to it which helps  to stabilize the quad-copter.</p><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1ADoMt9xYyqgNj0iC3IfAmXPa2pp97RhNrQ"></p><div><p>2.) Ir sensors :- The sensors which we used were IR sensors (GP2Y0A02YK0F ) . Its range is from 20-150 cms.</p><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1nONCx4hxjVkXl1N-QvkzRRZcjU7K1Vu1nQ" alt=""></p><p>So the basic concept behind our quadcopter is :</p><p>1)It  uses two sets of identical fixed pitched propellers; two clockwise (CW) and two counter-clockwise (CCW). These use variation of RPM to control lift and torque. Control of vehicle motion is achieved by altering the rotation rate of one or more rotor discs, thereby changing its torque load and thrust/lift characteristics.</p><p>2)This system uses a set of three angles to describe the orientation of the multirotor around the three spacial dimensions.They are called <strong>roll, pitch, and yaw</strong>.</p><ul><li>The roll angle of the multirotor describes how the craft is tilted side to side. Rotation about the roll axis is like tilting your head towards one of your shoulders. Rolling the multirotor causes it to move sideways.</li><li>The pitch angle of the multirotor describes how the craft is tilted forwards or backwards. Rotation about the pitch axis is like tilting your head in order to look up or down. Pitching the multirotor causes it to move forwards or backwards.</li><li>The yaw angle of the multirotor describes its bearing, or, in other words, rotation of the craft as it stays level to the ground. Rotation about the yaw axis is like when you shake your head to say “no.” </li></ul><p>3)At the root of all the multirotor’s movements is the rotational speed of the motors. By adjusting the relative speeds of the motors in just the right ways, keeping in mind that the rotational speed of the motors determines how much lift each prop produces, the flight controller is able to cause the multirotor to rotate around any of the directional axes (roll, pitch, and yaw), or make the multirotor gain or lose altitude.</p><p>4)To make the multirotor rotate about the roll or pitch axes, the flight controller makes the motors on one side of the multirotor spin faster than the motors on the other side. This means that one side of the multirotor will have more lift than the other side, causing the multirotor to tilt.</p><p>So, for example, to make a quadcopter roll right (or rotate about the roll axis clockwise), the flight controller will make the two motors on the left side of the multirotor spin faster than the two motors on the right side. The left side of the craft will then have more lift than the right side, which causes the multirotor to tilt.</p><p>5)Similarly, to make a quadcopter pitch down (rotate about the pitch axis clockwise) the flight controller will make the two motors on the back of the craft spin faster than the two motors on the front. This makes the craft tilt in the same way that your head tilts when you look down.</p><p>Basically what it does is , it sends the analog input to arduino mini pro which then process it and finally sends  its value.</p><p>The basis goal of our project was to make a quad that avoid obstacles. So what we did is that we gave input to the <em style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17px; font-variant: inherit;">aileron and elevator </em>from our obstacle avoiding setup. And in our obstacle avoiding setup we used sharp IR sensors and Aurdino pro mini. So the IR sensors get input according to the obstacle and give it to the arduino pro mini. Then the arduino gives appropriate signals to the aileron and elevators such that the quad moves away from the obstacle.</p></div>
