</ol><p>We have used stepper motors... And because they are of very less torque the wheels are moving very slowly and that too only on very smooth surfaces.</p><p>The drivers used for the stepper motors are ULN2803A costing around 15 Rs.</p><p>Model 2:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_EoRfX4KBD8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OmetQEKIyfk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<div>Problems Faced:</div>
<div>To increase the strength of this mechanism we had to use small pieces of ply which increased the weight of the plane. The big compartments used in this mechanism also decreased the exposure value of propellers. Hence the 4 motors were not able to lift up the plane. </div>
