<div>Problems Faced:</div><div>To increase the strength of this mechanism we had to use small pieces of ply which increased the weight of the plane. The big compartments used in this mechanism also decreased the exposure value of propellers. Hence the 4 motors were not able to lift up the plane. </div><div>Model 3:<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5HJ5QXE1sdM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div><ol>Problems Faced:<br> Since the whole body was handmade it was unsymmetrical. The plane was not stable in hover mode </ol>
