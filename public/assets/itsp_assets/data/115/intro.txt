<p>We had firstly planned to make the bot GPS controlled...which would go to the desired place as entailed by the user.
However, we faced extreme difficulty in interfacing the GPS module with the arduino due to which we decided to drop the idea of GPS module and instead worked out an interactive interface which would play well with the user. The user would sketch the path he/she has in mind so that the bot, if more advanced with fitted grippers and other sensors, would do the  work for the user. Then the bot would return to the starting point along the shortest route.</p><p><a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/S7fsPo87eY4/hqdefault.jpg"></a></p>
