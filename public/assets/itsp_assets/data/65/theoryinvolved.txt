<li>The Electronic Speed Controller operates our brushless motor. The motor is attached to the <strong>fan</strong>, which has forward curved blade.</li>	
<li>As the fan blades turn,they force air into the collecting bag at high speed.The collecting bag is porous which allows only the air to pass through.</li>	
<li>This creates a pressure difference between the fan and the dust particles at the collecting end.The inlet and the outlet are designed in such a  way so as to ensure the flow of dust particles in the correct direction.</li></ol><ul>

<li>We are using a 1100KV Outrunner Brushless Motor to control the fan used for vacuuming.</li>	
<li>We used Brushless motor instead of normal brushed dc motor as it has high RPM,high torque to weight ratio,more torque per watt,reduction of EMI,etc.</li>	
<li>Electronic Speed Controller i.e. ESC is an electronic circuit used to control the speed,direction of Brushless motor.</li>	
<li>We are using rechargeable Lithium Ion battery to provide power to the brushless motor.</li></ol><ul>

<li>Ultrasonic ranging module HC - SR04 provides 2cm - 400cm non-contact measurement function, the ranging accuracy can reach to 3mm.</li>	
<li>The transmitter sends sound wave to an obstacle and calculates the time required by the receiver to receive the reflected sound wave.</li>	
<li>The distance between the sensor and the obstacle thus can be calculated by using the speed of sound and the time required.</li></ol><ul>

<li>We are using Arduino Mega 2560.</li>	
<li>Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller which has 54 digital input/output pins(of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs),16 analogs inputs,4 UARTs,a 16 MH zcrystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.</li>	
<li>We are controlling brushless motor,DC motors,ultrasonic sensors using the Arduino.</li></ol><ul>

<h3>Other Electronic Equipments</h3></li></ul><ol>
	
<li>L293D : It is a 16 pin motor driver IC which can control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction.</li>	
<li>MOSFET BS-170 : It acts as a switch to start and stop the motors when supplied with a signal from the Arduino.</li>	
<li>7805 IC : It is a voltage regulator IC which converts the voltage from 12V to 5V.</li>	
<li>7809 IC : Similar to 7805 IC,it is used to step down the voltage from 12V to 9V.</li></ol>
