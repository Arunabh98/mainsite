	The basic principle of vacuum cleaner is 
	<strong>pressure difference</strong>. We have used <strong>centrifugal forward curved fan</strong> to create suction. A porous collecting bag is connected to the vacuum for the air to pass through. Air inside the cleaner has high speed due to the fan,whereas the air outside is almost static. The inlet and the outlet are aligned in a particular way. Due to this, the pressure difference created ensures that the dust particles flow from the collecting end (inlet) towards the collecting bag.</p><ul>

	We have used HC-SR04 utrasonic sensor to calculate the distance of the obstacle. It is controlled using an arduino.</p><p>
	To start measurement, Trig of SR04 receives a pulse of high (5V) for at least 10us. This initiates the sensor which transmit out 8 cycle of ultrasonic burst at 40kHz and wait for the reflected ultrasonic burst and sets Echo pin to high.When the receiver receives the reflected wave,the Echo pin is set to low. The distance thus can be obtained by the equation.</p><p>
	<strong>Distance in centimeters=(Time/2)*340*100=Time/58</strong> (where <strong>Time</strong>=time during which the Echo pin was high).</p><ul>

<h3>Arduino</h3></li></ul><p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/img.iluria.com/product/1D8C10/45B9A9/330xN.jpg"></p><p>We have used arduino MEGA 2560 in our bot. It is a microcontroller which has 54 digital input/output
 pins(of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs),16 analogs inputs,4 
UARTs,a 16 MH zcrystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an 
ICSP header, and a reset button.</p><p> The pins on the Arduino can be configured as either inputs or outputs. The input output pins can directly become HIGH or LOW which makes it easier to code.The coding in arduino is similar to that of C++.</p>
