<p>The GPS system will inform the bot of its current location. The  digital compass will align the bot in the direction of the target. </p><p>The
object is detected using an ultrasound sensor. The sensor sends a burst of
ultrasound which eventually hits an object in path and then returns back to the
source .The sensor then calculates the time taken by these bursts to come back
and estimate it’s distance from the bot. The sensor will be rotated in a field
of 180  ̊. This information is then passed on to the
micro-controller which then sends command to the motors on the wheels to turn
accordingly.</p><p>  The wheels will be attached with 360  ̊ servos.</p>
