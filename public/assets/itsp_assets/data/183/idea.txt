<p>The<strong> GPS <span class="ethsaiz" id="ethsaiz_2" style="height: 14px;">system</span></strong> will inform the bot of its <strong>current location</strong>. The <strong> digital compass</strong> will <strong>align</strong> the bot in the <strong><span class="ethsaiz" id="ethsaiz_1" style="height: 14px;">direction</span> of the target</strong>. </p><p>Any<strong> obstacle</strong> is <strong>detected</strong> using an <strong>ultrasound sensor</strong>. The sensor sends a burst of
ultrasound which eventually hits an object in path and then returns back to the
source .The sensor then calculates the time taken by these bursts to come back
and estimate itâ€™s distance from the bot. There is a <strong>primary sensor which is fixed</strong> and always <strong>faces the direction</strong> in which the <strong>bot moves</strong>. In the event of obstacle detection, the <strong>bot turns till this sensor is clear</strong>. A <strong>secondary sensor</strong> mounted on a servo <strong>turns to face the obstacle</strong>. The <strong>bot then moves forward  till the secondary sensor is clear</strong>, after which it <strong>reorients</strong> itself towards the <strong>destination with a new set of GPS and compass <span class="ethsaiz" id="ethsaiz_3" style="height: 14px;">data</span></strong>.The above is repeated every time an obstacle is detected.</p>
