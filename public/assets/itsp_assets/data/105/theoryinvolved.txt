<p> In the Rocker Bogie mechanism ,the front wheels climb up/down the obstacle ,the middle wheels follow and the rear wheels push the bot  forward.We designed the bot in solidworks using solidworks simulation.Thrust bearings were used to facilitate free rotation and ball joints were used to attach the chassis to the rocker to ensure that both sides of the bot can move smoothly even when the bot is moving over uneven terrain.L-clamps are used to fix the motor.The motor should produce sufficient torque.</p><p>   The IC 7805 converts 12 V from the battery to 5 V required for Arduino and logic supply voltage of L293D motor driver IC.L293D motor driver ic starts or stops the bot .It can also change the direction of motion of the bot.When the enable pin of L293D gets low input ,the motor stops rotating.If the enable pin of L293D gets high input ,then the motors rotate if the 2 inputs are different.Reversing the inputs reverses the direction of rotation of the motors.The IC 7805 and battery connections are done using a general purpose pcb as the maximum current drawn by 6 wheels can exceed the maximum current capacity of breadboard. </p><p> To turn the bot to the left or right using electronic differential , we had two options-using the pulse width modulation pins of Arduino or rotating the wheels on one side of the bot while keeping the other side wheels fixed.Using PWM , the bot turned too slowly.However , by keeping the wheels on one side fixed ,the bot turned properly so we used this method.</p>
