</ol><p>Accelerometers are used to detect the motion of the fingers which in turn will help in the various functions of the mouse accordingly. The rotation of accelerometers will enable the functions like movement of cursor, scrolling and dragging to work. Integration is required to convert acceleration values into velocity which is used for movement of cursor.</p><p>We are using Arduino Leonardo to generate data due to the movement of the glove. Arduino Leonardo has specific functions related to mouse which will help us in our project.</p><p>Further, we are using push buttons to click, which will output LOW value when pressed and accordingly it will click.</p><p> We are working with the bluetooth module HC-05 to make the mouse wireless and are thinking of ways to give an external power supply.</p><p><strong>Problems Faced:</strong></p><p>Initially, we were facing a lot of problems while running the code for the movement of the cursor. But now this problem has been solved by using more sensitive accelerometer MMA7361-L. Earlier we were using the accelerometers ADXL335 which was not as sensitive.</p><p>Further, we will also be using a power supply such as a power booster or just an external battery (whatever suitable), to make our glove wireless.</p><p>As of now we are facing trouble with the HC-05 bluetooth module which we are using to make the mouse wireless. We currently are unable to run any code after connecting the arduino, with the help of a bluetooth module to the bluetooth of the laptop.</p></div><ol><br></ol>
