The rotation of accelerometers will enable the functions like movement of cursor, scrolling and dragging to work. We have also used IR Sensors. When our palm is open, the reading in the IR is constant and we can move the mouse. When the sensore is blocked by closing our fist, the Readings in the IR vary and we can then scroll. Integration is required to convert acceleration values into velocity which is used for movement of cursor.</p><p>We are using Arduino Leonardo to generate data due to the movement of the glove. Arduino Leonardo has specific functions related to mouse which will help us in our project.</p><p>Further, we are using push buttons to click, which will output LOW value when pressed and accordingly it will click.</p><p><strong>Problems Faced:</strong></p><p>Initially, we were facing a lot of problems while running the code for the movement of the cursor. But now this problem has been solved by using more sensitive accelerometer MMA7361-L. Earlier we were using the accelerometers ADXL335 which was not as sensitive.</p><p>Further, we will also be using a power supply such as a power booster or just an external battery (whatever suitable), to make our glove wireless.</p><p>We were facing trouble with the HC-05 bluetooth module which we are using to make the mouse wireless. Normal Bluetooth devices cannot work as a Human Interface Device unlike the arduino Leonardo. We currently are unable to run any code after connecting the arduino, with the help of a bluetooth module to the bluetooth of the laptop.</p></div><ol><br></ol>
