<div>The accelerometers sense the movement and through arduino we can see the acceleration values on our screen. These acceleration values we have integrated into velocity which finally determines the cursor movement. So finally, the tilting of accelerometers lead to the movement of cursor.</div>
<div>For scrolling, we have used the the difference in the acceleration values of the accelerometer for scrolling and for movement. And depending on this value of difference in accelerations the mouse scrolls, when the accelerometer on the index finger(for scroll) rotates relative to that on the palm(for moving cursor).</div>
<div>The push buttons when pressed send LOW value as an output in an arduino which results in a click.</div>
<div> For double clicking, we have coded in the following way:- if once the output by push button goes LOW and then again it goes HIGH and stays HIGH, it will take it as a single click; if after going HIGH it again goes LOW, then depending upon time gap between the two subsequent clicks(LOWs) it will be decided if its to be taken as a double click or a single click. For double click, the time gap should be less then a particular value.</div><div>Dragging is a combination of single-left-clicking and movement of cursor of mouse.</div>
