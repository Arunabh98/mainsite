<h3>Week 1 (May 18th -24th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">To research about various accelerometers and arduino boards. To learn basic arduno coding and to buy the components.</p><ul>
<li>Accomplished</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">    Researched about the accelerometers and bought some components.</p><h3>Week 2 (May 25th- May 31st)</h3><ul><li>Planned                                                     
<ul>
<li>To test the accelerometers.</li><li>To begin coding for movement of cursor.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished    - Tested the accelerometers and began coding.</li></ul><h3>Week 3 (June 1st - June 7th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>To complete the code for cursor movement.</li><li>To code for clicking with the help of push buttons.</li><li>To research about power supply that can be used to make our glove wireless.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>What we achieved<ul><li>Completed the code for single-clicking.</li><li>Coded for the movement of cursor though it is not working smoothly.</li><li>Researched about power boosters and batteries that can be used as an external power supply for the arduino.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (June 8th - June 14th)</h3><ul><li>Planned 
<ul>
<li>To perfectly code for cursor movement.</li><li>To code for scrolling of the mouse.</li><li>To decide on what power supply we would finally use.</li><li>To code for double-clicking.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished
<ul><li>Rectified the errors in the cursor movement, which is now functioning well</li><li>Finished coding for the scroll function.</li><li>Researched more about bluetooth modules and power boosters. </li><li>Coded for double-clicking, though it wasn't functioning as desired.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 15th - June 21st)</h3><ul><li>Planned 
<ul>
<li>To complete the coding part.</li><li>To properly run the code for double-clicking and also the dragging part.</li><li>To fit the accelerometers and the push buttons, etc. on to the glove</li><li>To work on making the glove wireless by using batteries and bluetooth module.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Accomplished
<ul><li>Finished coding for dragging and clicking, so the coding part is almost done.</li><li>Made a workable prototype by attaching the accelerometers and push buttons on the glove.</li><li>Bought the bluetooth module.</li><li>We tried to use the bluetooth module for making the glove wireless, though we were unable to run the codes on the laptop, after connecting it with the arduino through a bluetooth.</li><li>We also discussed about various positions where the push buttons can be placed for proper clicking.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 22nd - June 28th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>Debugging of the code.</li><li>To work on the bluetooth module and to make the glove wireless</li><li>To fix any glitch.</li><li>To look into the aesthetics.</li><li>We will try to use an alternative(like a powerbooster) for the battery we are using to provide external power supply to the arduino.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished
<ul><li>Debugged all errors and removed the glitches.</li><li>The bluetooth module HC-05 was not a Human Interactive Device so we cannot use it for our project. We could have used the BlueSMiRF module but we could not find it in Lamington and after that it was too late to order it as it would take a long time for it to be shipped. </li></ul></li></ul>
