<p>HARDWARES Involved:</p><ul><li>Arduino leonrdo - Arduino is used to collect all the readings and data. The ATmega in the Leonardo has some inbuilt functions which helped us to perform the functions of the                              mouse and the keyboard.</li><li>MMA7361L - Accelerometers that are used to measure the component of gravity in the various axis'. </li><li>IR Sensor(TCRT5000) - Reading of the IR sensor is used to decide between the cursor's movement and the scrolling function. </li><li>Push buttons - It is used for clicking.(both right and left click) One push button was attached on the arduino to toggle the working of the glove.</li><li>Bluetooth Module (HC-05) - We planned to use HC-05 to make our mouse wireless. </li></ul><p>SOFTWRE Involved:</p><ul><li>Arduino - The code was written in Arduino software. The same software was used to upload the code to the Arduino board.</li><li>Teraterm - Teraterm was used to read the recieved data on the bluetooth comport.</li></ul><p>Problems Faced</p><ul><li>Accelerometer - First we were using ADXL335 but due to low sensitivity we switched to MMA7361L. Initially we used the accelerometer to record the acceleration due to the                             movement of our hands. But many times the reading was absurd. So instead we used the accelerometer to measure the gravity component and changed                                 our                           code accordingly.</li><li>Scrolling function - Initially we placed two accelerometers. One on the back of the hand and the other on the index finger. If the index finger was moved relative to the other                                   accelerometer, then there comes a difference in the readings of the two accelerometers which was used for scrolling, but the results were not as per                                         desired. We then used an IR sensor and removed the accelerometer on the index finger. When the readings in the IR sensor was below a given threshold                                 (On curling our fingers like when we make a fist) then the main accelerometer reading was used for scrolling.(Movement of the cursor was restricted while                                 scrolling)</li><li>  Bluetooth Module - We were facing trouble with the HC-05 bluetooth module which were using to make the mouse wireless. Normal Bluetooth devices cannot work as a                                          Human Interface Device unlike the arduino Leonardo. We currently are unable to run any code after connecting the arduino, with the help of a bluetooth                                    module to the bluetooth of the laptop. The required bluetooth module was BlueSMiRF but we were unable to find it in lamington and it was difficult to find.                                  Moreover it would take too long to be delivered.</li></ul>
