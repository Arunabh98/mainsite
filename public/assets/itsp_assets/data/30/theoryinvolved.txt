<h3>Accelerometer</h3><ul><li>The ADXL335 is a small, thin, low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with signal conditioned voltage outputs. The product measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of Â±3 g. It can measure the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration.<br>(Source: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/adxl335.pdf">https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/adxl335.pdf</a>)</li><li>In our project, It is used as tilt sensor by measuring static acceleration of gravity.</li></ul>
