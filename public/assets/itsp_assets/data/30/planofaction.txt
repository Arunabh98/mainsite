<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned<br>1. To gather knowledge about arduino hardware and arduino IDE pkatform.<br>2. To go through various webpages and videos to learn more about need of  our project.<br>3. Finalize components that we are going to use in our project.</li></ul><ul>
<li>Accomplished<br>1. Finalized components eg. accelerometer  ADXL335,  RF module R433A, ultrasonic sensor HCSR-04,  arduino boards UNO &amp; Mega.<br>2. Learned about different functions and commands used in arduino IDE eg. digitalWrite(), pinMode() etc.</li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 25th- 31th )</h3><ul><li>Planned<br>1. To buy all the components that we had finalized in the first week.<br>2. To test accelerometer and learn about its working and data outcomes.</li><li>Accomplished<br>1. Understood the working mechanism of ADXL335.<br>2. Wrote a simple code to get the readings of accelerometer in different orientation.</li></ul><h3>Week 3 (June 1st - 7th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<br>1. To test RF module with arduino to send readings of accelerometer to another arduino board.<br>2. To vary speed of motor according to the readings received.</li><li>Accomplished<br>1. Learned to use VirtualWire library.<br>2. Finally we were able to get accelerometer reading through RF module.<br>3. Wrote a code to vary speed of motor according to the readings received.<br>4. But that only worked for LED and not for 12 Volt 300 rpm DC motor.</li></ul><h3>Week 4 (June 8th - 14th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<br>1. To find a way to run a 12 Volt 300 rpm DC motor with an arduino PWM pin(operating voltage 5V) at a voltage greater than 5 volts.<br>2. To find a perfect chassis for our bot.</li><li>Accomplished<br>1. We are finally able to construct TIP122 circuit to run motors at 12V.<br>2. To run motor in both directions, we tried to construct a circuit using 2 TIP122 transistor(per motor), but it didn't work.<br>3. We decided to use acrylic material for our chassis.</li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 15th - June 21st)</h3><ul><li>Planned<br>1. To find a way to run motors in both the directions.<br>2. To calibrate accelerometer.<br>3. To assemble the components.</li></ul><ul><li>Accomplished
<ul>
<li>Checked the new tilt mechanism. It was perfect but was ver heavy.</li><li>Made a new tilt mechanism again</li></ul></li></ul>
