</ol><p>Motor Driver DRV8825:We used this particular motor driver for stepper motors because it is rated for 2.2A current per phase and since our motors are high torque motors and rated for 3A current.We designed the circuit  with safety precautions for arduino MEGA and other components using transistors as switches for providing 12V voltage across the electromagnets which control the falling of flaps corresponding to the binary string that is to be painted(the image was converted to black and white using threshold and greyscale reduction and then to a array with binary inputs correspoding to black and white respectively)</p><p>Arduino Mega(Atmega 2560):We needed large number of outputs since there were 50 electromagnets to be controlled so we decided to use Arduino Mega as its analog pins can also be used as digital outputs.</p><p>Stepper Motors:Since we needed a controlled displacement in vertical direction ,we decided to go for stepper motors as they give precise step contolled motion.</p>
