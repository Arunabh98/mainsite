<p><strong>1. WIRELESS COMMUNICATION:</strong></p><p>Wireless communication is achieved between the android application and the chip by interfacing bluetooth- low energy module. Commands to be send to microcontroller from the android device is achieved wirelessly by using Bluetooth as the mediator.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>UART COMMUNICATION:</strong></p><p>The arduino program has been written to implement the turning on/off of the buzzer as per the instruction sent by the user through the android app.</p><p> Arduino Uno is interfaced with HC-05 Bluetooth module. The Arduino takes the commands and sends it through the output pin assigned to it. The output pin is connected to the buzzer.The buzzer operates accordingly. The commands by arduino are taken in using UART communication.</p><p><strong>3.ANDROID PROGRAMMING:</strong></p><p><strong></strong>  We have made an android app with which the user finds the lost object. The user can give commands to turn on/off the buzzer after connecting the android device's bluetooth to the bluetooth module of the device(chip).And the user can also see the signal strength of how near/far the lost object is.</p><p><strong>4. MODES AND WORKING OF THE BLUETOOTH MODULE:</strong></p><p><strong>  </strong>We have put the bluetooth module into sniff mode to reduce the power consumption which becomes active only when another bluetooth device is connected to it.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
