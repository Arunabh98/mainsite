<p><strong>Mechanical Aspect:</strong></p><p>After deciding on the type of project, we had started to look for a suitable linear actuator.</p><p><img src="http://s11.postimg.org/hffyiy5sj/Picture1.gif"></p><p>We used a large rectangular Wooden Block as the base.The two 500 cm rods were fixed on it using metal brackets to give them some clearance from the ground level.</p><p>A DC motor was fixed on one side the board in a fixed enclosure. The other end supported a pulley system. A timing belt was wound over the DC motor using a gear. This completed the circular track so that we could achieve linear translation at suitable speeds.</p><p><img src="http://s8.postimg.org/74eyjx4zp/Snapshot_20150610.jpg"></p><p>The  next hurdle was to attach a servo motor onto the base so that we could rotate the Foosball Rod. For that we came up with a suitable structure so that there is no contact of the immovable part with the movable components.</p><p>Next we fixed the Servo to the rod using wooden fixtures.</p><p>We made four of these structures to imitate one player of the game.</p><p><strong>Electrical Components:</strong></p><p>To control the Motors we used An Arduino Uno micro-controller. The Motor driver H-Bridge L298 was used to relay the signal from Arduino to the Motor. One such Driver controlled two DC motors.</p><p><img src="http://www.haoyuelectronics.com/Attachment/L298N_module/1.jpg" style="width: 337px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" alt=""></p><p>The DC Motors were powered using 12V Lead-Acid Batteries. Two such batteries powered 4 Dc motors.</p><p>Another two 6V Lead Acid batteries were used to power 4 9kg-cm Servo motors.</p><p><strong>Control Equipment:</strong></p><p>We used A USB Gamepad to input the user commands. A program "JoyToKey" was used to convert the gamepad iput into Keyboard input. These inputs were relayed using Processing to Arduino and then converted to digital signals by the L298 bridge. Obviously the use of a Laptop was required . Due to the nature of our coding, any kind of input could have as easily been used to control the Motors.</p>
