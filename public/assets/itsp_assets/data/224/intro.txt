<p>Our team’s aim during the entire course of the ITSP Project slot was to make a working Robotic Device that allows the User to play Foosball(Table Football) remotely.                  Basically the game is played by a Human player against our working ‘Bot’, which in turn is remotely controlled by another User. The reason we have decided to control the Bot remotely rather than program it to play itself is because we want to control the reaction time of the bot as much as we can without inserting a factor of unwanted scarcity of resources.                    With this Bot we aim to achieve better than human accuracy and skill.</p><p>                                                                                  <img src="http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/foosball-table-top-view-direct-wooden-showing-blue-red-team-green-marked-pitch-isolated-white-background-33406145.jpg"></p>
