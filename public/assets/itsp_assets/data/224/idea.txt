But the basic Principles remain the same. There would be a player to control the 4 rods that make up one side of the foosball table remotely. Each rod's movement would employ Linear as well rotational motion. The Linear motion is achieved through an actuator while the roational part is handled by a high torque Servo.</p><p>Concept 1: The motor for the linear track.</p><p>The linear track was supposed to be portable, easy to make and should allow complete movement of the Foosball rod.</p><p>Problems Faced: The linear track could not achieve the desired speed with a stepper motor due to the high torque requirement. We needed to to support the rod-base junction, one servo, the rods and the players itself. We then proceeded to replace the Stepper motor with a dc motor losing some amount of accuracy.</p><p><img src="https://www.mpja.com/images/18866.jpg"><img src="http://ap-physics.david-s.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/d.c-mototr.png"></p><p>Concept 2: To attach the servo to the rod.</p><p>We decide to attach firmly the Servo blades to a wooden piece. This wooden block already had a carved out cylindrical hole to make room for one end of the Foosball rod. This allowed it to fit freely and then be fit into place with the help of two screws.</p><p>Problems Faced: Due to the limited amount of movement in the linear motion, the movement of the servo was obstructed and not a 100% coverage of the Foosball table was achieved. Therefore we replace the juncture with another kind of fixture.</p><p><img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="file:///C:/Users/Harsh/Documents/Youcam/Snapshot_20150610_2.JPG"></p><p><img src="http://s15.postimg.org/nhwhxpc0b/Snapshot_20150610_2.jpg"></p>
