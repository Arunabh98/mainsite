<p>Our product will be of great utility to the speech-impaired. They currently face great inconvenience as only a tiny fraction of the population can understand sign language, their primary means of communication. Thus, they are forced to use an interpreter.  If they use our gloves, they can become independent in their daily routine. </p><p> Our project is not a novel idea as a few companies have already attempted to develop such gloves. However, they developed prototypes at the exorbitant cost of $1000 or more. We intend to diminish that cost by a factor of 5 or more.</p>
