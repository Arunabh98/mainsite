<h3>Week 1 (May 6th -12th)</h3><ul>
</ul><ul><li>We dedicated this week to planning.<ul><li>Decided on the design of the glove and the position of flex and contact sensors</li><li>Decided to use an AtMega 32 for processing the readings and a Bluetooth Module for sending data to the App.</li></ul></li><li>Purchased the requisite items.</li><li>Decided on a model for the contact sensors.</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><h3>Week 2 (May 13th- 19th )</h3><ul><li>Over the course of this week, we tested the individual components of our project.<ul><li>Tested the microcontroller and Bluetooth module and made sure they were compatible.</li><li>Were successful in interfacing the Bluetooth Module with AtMega32 using UART protocol.</li><li>Began to learn basic Android App-making.</li><li>Tested the flex sensors and tabulated the resistance readings for various radii of curvature.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 20th - 26th)</h3><ul><li>Stitched the flex sensors into the gloves and also attached the contact sensors.<br><ul><li>Tested the contact sensors and modified their orientation for greater accuracy.</li></ul></li><li>Developed an Android App which enabled the user’s phone’s Bluetooth and could receive data from the microcontroller.<ul><li> Debugged and tested this App by sending letters from the microcontroller to the phone.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 27th - June 2nd)</h3><ul>
</ul><ul>
<li>Tackled the challenge of distinguishing between letters that have similar signs<ul>
<li>Decided to incorporate accelerometers in our project to distinguish between letters that have similar signs.
<ul>
<li>Decided to implement dynamic time warping (DTW) to match the accelerometer readings with the template readings.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Decided to use ATMega 2560 instead of ATMega 32 as it had greater processing power, more ADC pins and greater memory.</li><li>Completed the framework of the App<br>
<ul>
<li>Included three screens and completed their aesthetic design.</li><li>Added text-to-speech capability.</li><li>Added spell-check capability.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 3rd - June 9th)</h3><ul><li>Took template readings for the flex sensors and contact sensors.</li><li>Wrote the code for the DTW algorithm and debugged it.</li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 10th - June 14th)</h3><ul><li>Took template readings for the accelerometer.</li><li>Integrated all the parts of our project.</li><li>Tested the gloves.</li></ul>
