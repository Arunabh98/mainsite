<p>We had planned to make a small prototype of B2 spirit bomber. B2 spirit, also known as the <strong>Stealth Bomber</strong>, is an American heavy strategic bomber, featuring low observable stealth technology designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defences; it is a flying design. In short, it passes through RADAR without being detected.We have made it using Balsa wood which is well known for it's light weight.Cutting of Balsa is done by Laser to be more exact in design and the airfoil used is CH10 as it provide a good lift. </p><p><a href="file:///C:/Users/Atish%20Sonawane/Desktop/CjXtdc4.jpg"></a></p>
