<ol><li>Our Project was motivated by segway.We decided to create self balancing bot which is balanced on two wheels.Bot has two platforms,motor's clamp and battery are attached to the bottom one and rest of electrical components are attached to the latter. </li><li>When bot is kept on ground,it will fall on either side.So to balance the bot we have to apply some force opposite to the direction of tilt to balance it.Thus we got the idea that if the bot tilts forward move the motors such that the bot moves forward,in bot frame of reference
there is a pseudo force opposite to the direction of tilt and bot gets balanced.</li><li>But what will drive the motor and at what speed should we drive the motor.To get the answer we had gone through number of reports and finally we got the idea to use IMU sensor that contains accelerometer and gyro to get angles and
 we should drive motor to speed proportional to tilt angle.Thus we used Arduino UNO as micro-controller which takes data from IMU sensor(about tilt angle) and send signals to motor about the direction it should rotate and the speed.But arduino can't drive 
the motor so we used motor driver for that.We are using simple PID algorithm to balance the bot.</li><li>At first we used bread board to test things.Single stranded wires and connectors were used.Electrical components like IMU and motor driver were fixed on breadboard,arduino was powered using USB and we used Lithium Polymer battery as power source. </li><li>We faced number of problems in doing this project.Designing the mechanical part was tough,it was difficult to decide where we should position the battery and other electrical components.At first we made 3 platforms but it was unstable and was not able to
balance on adjusting PID values.So we switched down to two platforms.Soldering wires on PCBs and other electrical components was not easy.Single stranded wire breaks on bending so we used multi stranded wire finally.Some of electrical components got damaged 
during the process due to bad connections.But we tackled those problems and finally bot was prepared. </li><li>On testing the final code,bot was not able to balance properly.We adjusted PID values to balance it better but it was no good.Till now we are searching what and where is the problem.</li></ol>
