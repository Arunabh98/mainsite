<p><strong>The details of various components are explained briefly below.</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Arduino microcontroller:</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>Arduino is a tool for making computers that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer. It's an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board.</li><li>
Arduino can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs from a variety of switches or sensors, and controlling a variety of lights, motors, and other physical outputs. Arduino projects can be stand-alone, or they can communicate with software running on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP.) The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source IDE can be downloaded for free.</li><li>
The Arduino programming language is an implementation of Wiring, a similar physical computing platform, which is based on the Processing multimedia programming environment.</li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">GY-80 IMU</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>
It is 10 degrees of freedom inertial measurement unit.We are using just the ADXL 345 accelerometer and L3G4200D gyro.</li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Accelerometer (3 Axis)</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>What's the use: 
<ul>
<li>Well it measures acceleration forces on its 3 axes. </li><li>                          Types of acceleration forces: 1) Static : gravity 2) dynamic : caused by moving or vibrating the accelerometer </li></ul></li><li>What are accelerometers useful for?
<ul>
<li>By measuring the amount of static acceleration due to gravity, you can find out the angle the device is tilted at with respect to the earth. By sensing the amount of dynamic acceleration, you can analyze the way the device is moving. At first, measuring 
tilt and acceleration doesn't seem all that exciting. However, engineers have come up with many ways to make really useful products with them.An accelerometer can help your project understand its surroundings better. </li></ul></li><li>Is it driving uphill? Is it going to fall over when it takes another step? Is it flying horizontally or is it dive bombing your professor ?
<ul>
<li>In the computing world, IBM and Apple have recently started using accelerometers in their laptops to protect hard drives from damage. If you accidentally drop the laptop, the accelerometer detects the sudden freefall, and switches the
 hard drive off so the heads don't crash on the platters. In a similar fashion, high g accelerometers are the industry standard way of detecting car crashes and deploying airbags at just the right time. </li></ul></li><li>What are accelerometers useful for?
<ul>
<li>Some accelerometers use the piezoelectric effect - they contain microscopic crystal structures that get stressed by accelerative forces, which causes a voltage to be generated. 
Sensing changes in capacitance,If you have two microstructures next to each other, they have a certain capacitance between them. If an accelerative force moves one of the structures, then the capacitance will change.Add some circuitry to convert from capacitance to voltage, and you will get an accelerometer.</li></ul></li><li>What things should I consider when buying an accelerometer?<ul>
<li>Analog vs digital: First and foremost, you must choose between an accelerometer with analog outputs or digital outputs. This will be determined by the hardware that you are interfacing the accelerometer with. Analog style accelerometers output a continuous voltage that is proportional to acceleration. E.g. 2.5V for 0g, 2.6V for 0.5g, 2.7V for 1g. Digital accelerometers usually use pulse width modulation (PWM) for their output. This means there will be a square wave of a certain frequency, and the amount of time the voltage is high will be proportional to the amount of acceleration.</li><li>Number of axes -         For most projects, two is enough. However, if you want to attempt 3d positioning, you will need a 3 axis accelerometer, or two 2 axis ones mounted at right angles.</li><li>Maximum swing -        If you only care about measuring tilt using earth's gravity, a 1.5g accelerometer will be more than enough. If you are going to use the accelerometer to measure the motion of a car, plane or robot, 2g should give you enough headroom to work with. For a project that experiences very sudden starts or stops, you will need one that can handle 5g or more. </li><li>Sensitivity - Generally speaking, the more sensitivity the better. This means that for a given change in acceleration, there will be a larger change in signal. Since larger signal changes are easier to measure, you will get more accurate readings.</li><li>Bandwidth - This means the amount of times per second you can take a reliable acceleration reading. For slow moving tilt sensing applications, a bandwidth of 50Hz will probably suffice. If you intend to do vibration measurement, or control a fast moving machine, you will want a bandwidth of several hundred Hz.</li><li>Impedance/buffering issues - This is by far the single most common source of problems in projects involving analog accelerometers, because so few people thoroughly read the required documentation. Both PIC and AVR datasheets specify that for A-D conversion to work properly, the connected device must have an output impedance under 10kO. Unfortunately, Analog Devices' analog accelerometers have an output impedance of 32kO. The solution to this is to use a low input offset rail to rail op amp as a buffer to lower the output impedance
. As far as we know, the DE-ACCM is the only accelerometer solution that takes care of this problem for you.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gyroscope : </span>  </strong><ul><li>Gyroscopes measure angular velocity, how fast something is spinning about an axis.</li><li>Why  :  Orientation of an object in motion, an accelerometer may not give you enough information to know exactly how it is oriented. Unlike accelerometers gyros are not affected by gravity, so they make a great complement to each other. You will usually see angular velocity represented in units of rotations per minute (RPM), or degrees per second . The three axes of rotation are either referenced as x, y, and z, or roll, pitch, and yaw.</li><li>In the past, gyros have been used for space navigation, missile control, under-water guidance, and flight guidance. Now they are starting to be used alongside accelerometers for applications like motion-capture and vehicle navigation.
</li><li>A lot of what was considered when selecting an accelerometer still applies to selecting the perfect gyro:<ul><li>Range - Make sure the maximum angular velocity you are expecting to measure does not exceed the maximum range of the gyro. But also, in order to get the best possible sensitivity, make sure your gyro's range isn't much greater than what you are expecting.</li><li>Interface - There is actually not much diversity in this section, 95% of the gyros we have feature an analog output. There are a few that have a digital interface - either SPI or I2C.</li><li>Number of axes measured - Compared to accelerometers, gyros are a little behind the curve. Only recently have inexpensive, 3-axis gyros begun to appear on the market. Most of our gyros are either 1- or 2-axis. When selecting those, you need to pay attention to which of the three axes the gyro will measure; for example, some two axis gyros will measure pitch and roll, while others measure pitch and yaw.</li><li>Power Usage - If your project is battery powered, you might want to consider how much power the gyro will consume. The required current consumption will usually be in the 100s of ï¿½A range. Some sensors also feature sleep functionality to conserve energy when the gyro isn't needed.</li><li>Bonus Features - Not much in this section is going to blow you away. Many gyros feature a temperature output, which is very useful when compensating for drift.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">L293D motor driver :</span></strong><ul><li>L293D is a typical Motor driver or Motor Driver IC which allows DC motor to drive on either direction.</li><li>L293D is a 16-pin IC which can control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction. It means that you can control two DC motor with a single L293D IC. Dual H-bridge Motor Driver integrated circuit (IC).</li><li>It works on the concept of H-bridge. H-bridge is a circuit which allows the voltage to be flown in either direction. As you know voltage need to change its direction for being able to rotate the motor in clockwise or anticlockwise direction, Hence H-bridge IC are ideal for driving a DC motor.
In a single l293d chip there two h-Bridge circuit inside the IC which can rotate two dc motor independently. Due its size it is very much used in robotic application for controlling DC motors. Given below is the pin diagram of a L293D motor controller.</li><li>There are two Enable pins on l293d. Pin 1 and pin 9, for being able to drive the motor, the pin 1 and 9 need to be high. For driving the motor with left H-bridge you need to enable pin 1 to high. And for right H-Bridge you need to make the pin 9 to high.</li><li>If anyone of the either pin1 or pin9 goes low then the motor in the corresponding section will suspend working. It's like a switch.</li></ul></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Voltage Regulator :</strong></span><ul><li>It is used to transform 12V to 5V.</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
