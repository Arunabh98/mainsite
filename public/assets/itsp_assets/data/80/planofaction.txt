<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned<ul><li>Get equipped with the required tools: basic data gathering, research work and searching for the required hardware and software resources.</li><li>Be ready with the final design and get it approved by the mentors.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished<ul><li>Completed the research work and were ready with the final project and plan of action.</li><li>Bought the gyroscope MPU-6050.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul><li>Planned                                                     
<ul>
<li>Get the accelerometer, gyroscope readings to measure the yaw, pitch and roll.</li><li>Code in the atmega16u2 micro controller of the Arduino to change its firmware.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished<br><ul><li>Used the 3 axis gyroscope/accelerometer, MPU-6050 with an Arduino Uno and communicate via the I2C protocol to get the values of Roll, Pitch &amp; Yaw to be printed on the screen using Serial communication.</li><li>Used the LUFA library to convert our Arduino into mouse/keyboard and tested it with the sample codes.</li><li>Started searching for LCD display.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>Complete the mouse.</li><li>Create a prototype for a keyboard.</li><li>Buy a google cardboard and use it with Cardboard app.</li><li>Buy a gun and decide the different kinds of buttons required.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Accomplished
<ul><li>Competed the mouse using the MPU-6050 for measuring the user's head movement (as movement of the mouse) and 2 simple push buttons (for left and right clicks).</li><li>Made external keyboard on a breadboard with simple push buttons.</li><li>Bought the google cardboard and used it using the Cardboard application by google.</li><li>Bought a gun and different types of buttons as per requitrement (push buttons, interlocked switches).</li><li>Fixed different kinds of switches on the gun at appropriate locations for ease of play and made the connections. Chaneg the code a bit according to the type of the switch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul><li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Set up interfacing with the mobile so as to display the laptop screen on the phone, properly altered.</li><li>Complete the gun.</li><li>Put together all the components into a head mount and work on its aesthetics.</li></ul></li><li>Accomplished:
<ul>
<li>Completed the gun working a bit on its aesthetics.</li><li>Fixed the 2 Arduinos and MPU-6050 sensor on a PCB and made the appropriate connections.</li><li>Fitted the head mount (The PCB, Google Cardboard, a few buttons and wires) using hard board.</li><li>Streamed the PC display to the mobile phone via USB tethering using the application Trinus Gyre VR, applying binocular rendering suitable for Google Cardboard.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul>
<li>Finish the fitting of the head mount</li><li>Give finishing touch to the project. </li><li>Complete the documentation and make a video showing its working.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Accomplished<ul>
<li>Completed the fixing of the head mount and worked a bit on its aesthetic values (painted it and fixed bands and foam for making it comfortable to wear).</li><li>Documented the project and made a video to demonstrate the working of the project.</li></ul></li></ul>
