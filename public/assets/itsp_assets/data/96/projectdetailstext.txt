<p>Using the above theory, we implemented the project at main gate of IITB. We fixed the camera on the foot over bridge at main gate and with some adjustments in the code, we could successfully count the number of vehicles plying on road.</p><p>During green signal, it was perfectly fine to calculate the number of moving vehicles. But the real problem arose in case of red signal where we had to calculate the number of stationary vehicles at the signal. For this we came up with a solution in which we counted the number of vehicles at three points. The first point being closest to camera, we could accurately calculate the number of vehicles crossing that point and that would be stopping at the red signal. The second line was away from the camera as seen in the image. When cars stopped crossing the first, we started calculating at second line and then for third. In this way with a bit less accuracy, we could calculate the number of vehicles upto 80 that were stationary at the signal.</p><p><strong>PROBLEMS FACED:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong>) The most serious issue we faced in the project was that the contours were obtained after 15 seconds after the starting of RED or GREEN function. Hence every time we missed nearly 15-20 vehicles. </p><p>We rectified the error by interlinking the functions such that first contours were drawn and then it was decided whether to use RED or GREEN function on that frame.</p><p>2) The second problem was that the heavy and light vehicles moved with different speeds. Hence the range we had set for light vehicle for its centroid to cross the line was ineffective as it would count the heavy vehicles 2-3 times. We sorted this out by separately calculating the area for heavy and light vehicles and setting the range accordingly.</p>
