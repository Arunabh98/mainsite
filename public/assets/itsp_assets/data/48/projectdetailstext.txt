<p>The Main Idea of our project was to create a bot that could move freely on land and even on surface of a water body.For that we simply used a plastic box as the main body of the bot which could float over water and then modified the wheels in such a way that they could facilitate the movement even on surface of water.During this project we first of did the electrical circuit making part which included soldering of 7805 IC and the L293D on the pcb along with making of the remote.Then we moved on to mechanical designing of the bot which included fitting motors on  the bot, designing the fins of the wheels, waterproofing the bot and separating the bot into 2 parts by acrylic sheet where the upper part included all electrical components and lower part contained the motors.</p>
