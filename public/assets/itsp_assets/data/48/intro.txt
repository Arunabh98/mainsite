	¨We have made a bot that
can travel on land and water.(Amphibian bot)
¨We wanted a body that can float on water
as well as it should not decay in water so we preferred plastic body.
¨We have done the water proofing of the
bot.
¨We also have made fins that efficiently
throw water backwards and facilitate the movement of our bot in water.</p><p>
