<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><p>     planned:</p><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Learning about solid works for designing the wheels and streamline
shape,purchasing parts required and
water proofing of
bot.</h3><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"> Learning matlab to plot the graph of
the depth of water that our bot will   measure.</h3><p>     Achieved:</p><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Planned the size of our bot and the wheel size</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Listed all the required items with the help of google and other sources.</p><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">planned:</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Designing
a ground based vehicle/bot according to maneuvering requirements like
identifying suitable motors and wheel size,placement of battery and electrical circuits on
the bot and also balancing the bot over water using our solid works       knowledge.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Achieved:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">we
purchased all the required electrical components and designed the circuit board</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</p><ul>
