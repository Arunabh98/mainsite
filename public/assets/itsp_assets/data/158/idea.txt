<p>If we can capture enough heat from a human hand and convert it efficiently to electricity, then we can power a flashlight without any batteries or kinetic energy.</p><p> An average human dissipates around 350,000 Joules per hour, or 97 watts. The average surface area of the human skin is 1.7 m<sup>2</sup> or 17,000 cm<sup>2</sup>, so the heat dissipation equals to (97/17000) * 1000 = <strong>5.7 mW / cm<sup>2</sup></strong>. <br>A useful area of the palm is about 10 cm<sup>2</sup>. This implies that 57 mW could be available.<br>The thermal efficiency of a Peltier tile is cited at about 10%.  This means that we should be able to generate 5.7mW in the palm of the hand. We knew that we needed at least 0.5 mW to obtain usable LED brightness. </p><p>PELTIER TILES:A semiconductor device which utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect">thermoelectric effect</a>. When a temperature difference exists across a material, charge carriers will start to diffuse from hot to cold. The separation of charges causes a potential difference across the material. The term "thermoelectric effect" encompasses the "seebeck effect" which is the conversion of temperature differences directly into electricity.</p><p><img src="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCLeU3OvJkcYCFSEkpgodeVsDaA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fnews%2Fbritish-columbia%2Fvictoria-teens-bright-idea-for-hollow-flashlight-lands-her-in-google-science-fair-finals%2Farticle12944206%2F&amp;ei=e7R-VffqNKHImAX5to3ABg&amp;bvm=bv.95515949,d.dGY&amp;psig=AFQjCNHDu7GfNIcX1eOSYY68umlFy0pvWA&amp;ust=1434453490286518"></p>
