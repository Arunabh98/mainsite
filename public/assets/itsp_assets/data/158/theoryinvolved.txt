<div>Our PROJECT THEORY involves:</div>
<div>CHARACTERIZING THE PELTIER TILES:</div><ul>
<li>SEEBECK EFFECT:The seebeck effect is a phenomemon in which a temperature difference between two dissimilar conductors or semiconductors( here peltier tiles ) produces a voltage difference between the two substances.When heat is applied to one of 2 conductors and connected to an electrical circuit, DC current flows through that circuit.The voltages produced by this effect is of the order of only a few mVs.

<p>Then an average human consumes approximately 2000 calories per day. Using a simple conversion, this amounts to <sup></sup>8.37 x 10<sup>6</sup> joules ingested per day.This means that the average person expends ~8.37 x 10<sup>6</sup> joules of energy per day.Assuming most of this energy leaves us in the form of heat, I calculate that on average we radiate ~350,000 J of energy per hour. Since Watt is just Joules per second, this is roughly equal to energy given off by a 100 Watt light bulb!</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCMbzvovKkcYCFSKspgodYxAAjQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFElkxJ2cdy4&amp;ei=vrR-VcacHqLYmgXjoIDoCA&amp;bvm=bv.95515949,d.dGY&amp;psig=AFQjCNHDu7GfNIcX1eOSYY68umlFy0pvWA&amp;ust=1434453490286518"></p><ul><li>
<p>We calculated that our bodies radiate 5.7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, but only 0.5 mW is needed to generate a bright light at the LED. We characterized both  Peltier devices. Both produced power, but only a few millivolts. W needed mininmum 2.5 V ! so we had to convert DC input to AC, and then run it through a oscillator circuit with a stepup transformer.</p></li></ul><p>BOOSTING UP THE VOLTAGE:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Direct Current cannot be multiplied, but if the DC is changed to AC, the voltage can be stepped up with a transformer . The answer lay in constructing a simple oscillator circuit with a step-up transformer. Searching the Internet, we came across an article about energy harvesting and the use of a power converter integrated circuit, LTC3108 The circuit contained FETâ€™s that would oscillate at voltages as low as 20mV. When used with a recommended   transformer, the IC would provide well over 2.5 volts AC using required capacitors.</p></li></ul>
