<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li>Planned</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Study of the project details and the learning part we need to know which includes the study of how much heat our hand radiates per cm. sq. and the area of peltier tiles to be exposed where we will hold the flashlight.Then calculating the values of the capacitors,etc. we need in the project.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Also study about the voltage booster device or the step up DC to DC convertor suitable in our project to boost the voltage we obtain from the heat of our hand.</p><ul><li>Accomplished</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Studied about the peltier tiles ( it's size ) to obtain maximum voltage, learnt about the voltage booster device to be used in our project here LTC-3108 (IC) as the step up DC/DC convertor and energy harvestor.</p><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul>
<li>Planned                                                     <ul><li>Designing and preparing the blueprint of the circuit and thereby fixing the values of different components to be used such as the turn ratio of the transformer etc.</li><li>buying the required components .</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?</li><li>Finalized the circuit and the values of the capacitors needed.<br><ul><li>Bought some small components required for the project.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:</li><li>Making a rough model of how our flashlight would look using peltier tiles and heat sink.</li><li>And also estimating the starting voltage we could obtain from the heat of our hand under some favourable conditions to obtain a minimum of 5degree temperature difference for our peltier tiles to work.</li><li>What we achieved
<ul>
<li>Made a rough structure of the flashlight and obtained quite a good amount of voltage ( in millivolts ).</li><li>Used four peltier tiles each of 4*4 cm.sq. area and aluminium as the heat sink.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>Once obtaining the IC ( ordered online ) and the transformer to be made on our own which could work at low  input voltages( of the order of 150-200 mVs), assembling all the components and obtain a complete circuit of the flashlight.</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>Since we ordered IC online it failed to come at the appropriate time, took more than 3 weeks to come  :-(</li><li>Which put a halt to our project since we could not find an alternative source to boost up the voltage of the order of millivolts.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>Debugging of the circuit and giving final finish to our flashlight.</li><li>Trying newer combinations of the circuit like by using other kind of ICs ( newer version of the IC being used )  to try increase the efficiency of the flashlight.</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>Since we got our ICs quite late we could not do much but prepare a final structure of our flashlight and the circuit .</li><li>Due to shortage of time we could not experiment much we earlier planned to do.</li></ul></li></ul>
