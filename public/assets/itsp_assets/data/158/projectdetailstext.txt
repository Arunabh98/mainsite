<p>Our first step was totally based on the research work so as to calculate:</p><ul><li>How much heat per cm. sq. we radiate in our innner palm.</li><li>The useful area of the palm and the power produced through it.</li></ul><p>Second step includes the correct size of the peltier tiles to be used to obtain optimum amount of voltage to light a LED, here we are using 4*4 cm.sq.area peltier tiles.</p><p>Third step and the most important one was boosting up the voltage:</p><ul><li>Direct Current cannot be multiplied, but if the DC is changed to AC, the voltage can be stepped up with a transformer . The answer lay in constructing a simple oscillator circuit with a step-up transformer.</li><li>Using an energy harvesting power converter integrated circuit LTC-3108.  The circuit contained FETâ€™s that would oscillate at voltages as low as 20mV. When used with a recommended   transformer, the IC would provide well over 2.5 volts AC.</li><li>Using 1:20 step-up transformer along with the IC in accordance with the input voltage we obtained from peltier tiles.</li><li>And also using capacitors in the circuit so as to store the energy from the input since the input is not constant and varies as the temperature difference ( obtained from heat of the hand and the surroundings) varies.</li></ul><p>Third and the final step includes the physical design of palmlight which contains:</p><ul><li>4*4 cm.sq. peltier tiles mounted on the aluminium sheet working as heat sink for the model.</li><li>Using four peltier tiles all connected in series with one another.</li><li>Outer covering of PVC sheet to give a structure to the flashlight.</li><li>LEDs</li><li>And finally the circuit which enables the flashlight to work.</li></ul>
