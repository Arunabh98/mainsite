<p>The voltage differences in the muscles is of the order of microvolts. The circuit essentially consists of Amplifiers which amplify these signals, thereby making them suitable for processing.</p><br>INA 106<br><br>The INA106 is a monolithic differential amplifier consisting of a precision op amp and on-chip metal film resistors. It measures and amplifies (gain = 10) the very small voltage differences between the two electrodes placed on the muscles.<br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/N2xwmO8wJeDSH3DhU8jqdct7jlPtbgqvNjH5gPGP3dg5qC0C6dUybF3zqH2Prcixy6Y_2ZlXBqTrAUSBFinGoxwawqlHAWpXju2ww3bm-vvvKsyEL0vu1LfvV32MBaSDz6rSdIw" width="234px;" height="169px;" style="border-style: none; border-width: initial; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);"><br><br>TL 072<br><br>The TL072 chip basically consists of two operational amplifiers, which have been used as inverting operational amplifiers in this circuit. Operational Amplifiers on their own have a very high open loop DC gain (around 20,000). Open Loop means that no feedback components are used around the amplifier so the feedback path or loop is open. This is very problematic, since it makes the amplifier unstable and very small fluctuations cause the output voltage to saturate. The output thus becomes very hard to control and is of little use for processing. This can be dealt with by connecting a suitable resistor across the amplifier from the output terminal back to the inverting input terminal to both reduce and control the overall gain of the amplifier. This produces an effect, known as Negative Feedback, resulting in a much smaller gain, which in turn gives a stable output and better control.<br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TuyMYginzahM5pQzbdHmaO2pB9VAiuV4YZKdBV2xQdEy_-YRGZulcyHeQwb6dDMoPeg0LkS5Li-hetCJtvGVSOEGTXD5bBv76fCRY0ABkUw3J30iyCKJopSoTrZp2VWFOi28pgs" width="182px;" height="138px;" style="border-style: none; border-width: initial; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);"><br><br><br><br><br>Negative Feedback<br><br>The process of “feeding back” a fraction of the output signal back to the input. In case of the inverting amplifiers used in this circuit, a part of the output is fed back to the negative or “inverting input” terminal of the op-amp through an external Feedback Resistor called Rf. This negative feedback results in the inverting input terminal having a different signal on it than the actual input voltage ie. the sum of the input voltage plus the negative feedback voltage. The real input signal is separated from the inverted input by using an Input Resistor, Rin. Also, the output signal is inverted, since the feedback goes to the negative or “inverting input” terminal.<br><br>The resulting gain of the amplifier, called the Closed Loop Gain, is much smaller than the Open Loop Gain, hence giving better control, albeit at the cost of a reduction in the gain.<br>
