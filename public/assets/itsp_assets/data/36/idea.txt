<p>Electromyography:</p><p>Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph, to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electrical potentialgenerated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement.EMG measures muscle response or electrical activity in response to a nerveâ€™s stimulation of the muscle.
During the test, one or more small patches (also called electrodes) are placed on the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity picked up by the electrodes is then displayed on an oscilloscope (a monitor that displays electrical activity in the form of waves).</p><p><img src="http://veritymedical.co.uk/upload/misc/ESS102_electr3.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://www.nrsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image15.png"></p><p><img src="http://www.nrsign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image14.png"></p><p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9acc21340fb9f173d69e079e5bab279f0a71c433/687474703a2f2f696d616765732e67697a6d61672e636f6d2f6865726f2f74686f756768745f636f6e74726f6c6c65645f7065726d616e656e745f70726f737468657469635f61726d2e6a7067"></p><p>PROBLEMS FACED:</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Frequently fluctuating signals</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Interference on using unshielded cables</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Unavailibilty of EMG electrodes.
