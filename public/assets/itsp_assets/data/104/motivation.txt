<p>There are different robotic arms with varying degrees of freedom of rotation trying to mimic a human hand that are used on day to day basis for industrial and also on consumer level.</p><p style="text-align: center;"> We wanted to make a part of a larger robot which can be used independently.</p><p style="text-align: center;">The robotic arm can be assembled with a larger robot as its part and hence used together.</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;">This robotic arm can be used to perform manual functions in human restricted areas like high radiation areas and also to use in fragile handling of objects.When interfaced with muscle sensors we can use the robotic arm to do the activities of a physically challenged person .</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rf2zkWSaUY8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
