You can typically identify the number of degrees of freedom by the number of actuators on the robot arm. Now this is very important - when building a robot arm you want as few degrees of freedom allowed for your application!!! Why? Because each degree requires a motor, often an encoder, and exponentially complicated algorithms and cost.</p><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention</span></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> The Robot Arm Free Body Diagram (FBD)</span></strong></em></p><p> The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention is the accepted method of drawing robot arms in FBD's. There are only two motions a joint could make: translate and rotate. There are only three axes this could happen on: x, y, and z (out of plane).</p><p>4 DOF Robot Arm, three are out of plane:</p><p>.<img src="http://www.societyofrobots.com/images/robot_arm_arm3DH.jpg"></p><p>3 DOF Robot Arm, with a translation joint:</p><p><img src="http://www.societyofrobots.com/images/robot_arm_arm2DH.jpg"></p><p>5 DOF Robot Arm:</p><p><img src="http://www.societyofrobots.com/images/robot_arm_arm5DH.jpg"></p><p>The shoulder actually has three coincident DOF.</p><p><img src="http://www.societyofrobots.com/images/robot_arm_humanDH.gif"></p><p>A DOF has its limitations, known as the configuration space. Not all joints can swivel 360 degrees! A joint has some max angle restriction. For example, no human joint can rotate more than about 200 degrees. Limitations could be from wire wrapping, actuator capabilities, servo max angle, etc. </p><p><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Robot Workspace</span> </em></strong></p><p>The robot workspace (sometimes known as reachable space) is all places that the end effector (gripper) can reach. The workspace is dependent on the DOF angle/translation limitations, the arm link lengths, the angle at which something must be picked up at, etc. The workspace is highly dependent on the robot configuration.</p><p><img src="http://www.societyofrobots.com/images/robot_arm_workspace1.jpg"></p><p>We need to also take into consideration of the arm sagging.</p><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mobile Manipulators</span></strong></em></p><p> A moving robot with a robot arm is a sub-class of robotic arms. They work just like other robotic arms, but the DOF of the vehicle is added to the DOF of the arm.</p><p><img src="http://www.societyofrobots.com/images/robot_arm_mobipulator.jpg"></p>
