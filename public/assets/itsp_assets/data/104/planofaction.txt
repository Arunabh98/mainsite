<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>This was a six week project, laid out in detail is the following.</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em><br></em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>Week 1</em></strong>:</h3><p><strong>Week wise plan of action and accomplishment</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Researched about all aspects of the project.(learning arduino coding using accelerometer ,flex potentiometer and servos and all the theoretical and practical setup).</p><h3><strong><em>Week 2</em></strong><strong style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;"><em>:</em></strong></h3><p>Week wise plan of action and accomplishment</p><p>we bought various items needed for the project and coded for different parts that can be controlled by an Arduino.</p><h3><em><strong>Week 3:</strong></em></h3><p>Week wise plan of action </p><p> We aim to complete the mechanical design by the end of
this time.</p><p>Accomplishment</p><p>We were able to complete the design partly not completely and it was completed by the end of the 4th week.</p><h3><em>Week 4:</em></h3><p>Week wise plan of action and accomplishment</p><p>implementation of the servo configurations on the mechanical parts individually and making them to work individually on a pre written code that runs the servos via the arduino.</p><p>we also tested the i2c protocol in an arduino.We completed the remaining of the mechanical part.</p><h3><em>Week 5:</em></h3><p>Week wise plan of action and accomplishment</p><p> To complete the coding required for the arduinos and completing the designing of the electronic circuitry and implementing it and testing it.</p><h3><em>Week 6:</em></h3><p>Week wise plan of action and accomplishment</p><p>Assemble the
mechanical and electrical part of our project. And also debugging the problems we faced in the coding part.</p>
