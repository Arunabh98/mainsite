</ol><p>Flex Sensors: The sensors that change in resistance depending on the amount of bend on the sensor.</p><p>They convert the change in bend to electrical resistance-the more the bend,the more the resistance.</p><p>Flex sensors are analog sensors and work as variable analog voltage dividers.</p><p>An <strong>accelerometer</strong> is a device that measures proper acceleration .</p><p>Multi-axis models of accelerometer are available to detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration  as a vector quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes), coordinate acceleration (so long as it produces g-force or a change in g-force), vibration, shock, and falling in a resistive medium (a case where the proper acceleration changes, since it starts at zero, then increases).Hence depending on the orientation we can write different values to the servo.</p><p><img src="http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/image/cache/data/ht/sensors/adxl335-breakout-500x500.jpg" style="width: 134px;"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/4/6/2/6/10264-01.jpg" style="width: 137px;"></p><p>PROBLEMS FACED:</p><p>At first we designed a palm made of wood trying to make it look like a real hand but then we had a problem in making it able to grip or pick up things. That's why we had to shift to aluminium based palm and fingers.</p><p><img src="https://bighome.iitb.ac.in/index.php/core/preview.png?file=%2FPhotos%2FIMG_20150615_201515%5B1%5D.jpg&amp;x=1366&amp;y=643&amp;a=true&amp;scalingup=0&amp;forceIcon=0" style="width: 313px; opacity: 0.5;"></p><p>PROBLEMS FACED:</p><p>We at first used two servos for the shoulder joint but then they started to get off sync and the servo blade hence got filed from inside by the metal gear and also one servo broke down.Hence we had to shift to one servo for the shoulder joint.</p><p>PROBLEMS FACED:</p><p>An accelerometer individually gives correct reading but if connected with servo it starts to give an anomaly.Hence we had to keep the accelerometer and servo connected to different arduinos.</p><p>PROBLEMS FACED:</p><p>The power source was a huge problem.The normal AA batteries would have an immense voltage drop across it and the servos weren't performing properly.So we had to shift to lead acid batteries for power supply.</p>
