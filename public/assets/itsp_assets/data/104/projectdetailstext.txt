<p><strong><em>Hand-</em></strong> We first thought of making the palm of the robotic arm with wood ,we made the complete palm with wood  by filing ang drilling it andfitted it with servos and was working but the problem with it was the fingers were not able the grip properly on to objects so we thought that we need not make it more human like but just enough to be able to do the pick and placing of items so we made another attachment that acts like a movable clamp made completely of aluminium .</p><p><strong><em>Fingers-</em></strong>The fingers that were first made had 2 dof that were able to move on a single servo but the later one had only one and was made of aluminium.</p><p><strong><em>Servos-</em></strong>The servos were bought from lamington road which were tested and fitted on the clamps .</p><p><strong><em>Flex-</em></strong>The flex sensors were four,three for the fingers and one for the wrist to find the resistivity required for the fingers to bend.</p><p><strong><em>Arduino-</em></strong>There were two arduinos needed ,we had one  so we went and bought another.we used i2c protocol so that the arduinos can communicate with each other and process the input and give the output values to the respective servos.</p><p><strong><em>Accelerometer-</em></strong>we bought an accelerometer initially thinking that we can make the arm work with a little bit of code ,but later found that it was very difficult so we got another accelerometer.Now it was working good with the joints.</p><p><strong><em>Joints,Clamps-</em></strong>We made arm completely out of aluminium from pipes and cutouts of sheets to form the clamps  to hold the servos.</p><p><strong><em>Length of the hand-</em></strong>The servos we very limited ,we thought the length was not important but later realised there was a huge load so decreased the length of the arm.</p><p><strong><em>dof-</em></strong>total degrees of a human hand were not possible due to minor adjusments requiring a lot of weight  ,so we bought it closest to a arm</p><p><strong><em>base stand and wood </em></strong>-the stand was made from an old aluminum pipe and the base was made from wood.</p><p><strong><em>gloves-</em></strong>the gloves were fitted with flex sensors,and bands were made to add the accelerometers.</p>
