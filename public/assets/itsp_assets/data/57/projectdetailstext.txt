<p>We used Python to implement the system with the motive that we do not have to worry a lot about the implementation details and more time could be devoted to study the patterns and understand them than implement.</p><hr id="horizontalrule"><h3></h3><h3>	Phase I - Design Patterns</h3><p>	All the design patterns were learnt, then implemented.We got each design pattern, Observer, Strategy and Decorator to work individually.We now had the base object oriented structure for the system.<br>	</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h3>Phase II - Simulation Algorithm</h3><p>	 A trait based simulation algorithm was implemented which could basic simulation.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h3>	Scope for further improvement</h3><p>	The project can be improved a lot, having a very ambitious goal, we didn't achieve the finish that we wanted<br>	</p><ul>	<li>Interface the algorithm and the structure.</li>	<li>Develop an interface were runtime changes from user-end are allowed</li></ul><p>	<strong> 	<br>	</strong></p>
