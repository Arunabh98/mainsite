<p>The idea of a vehicle able to travel on almost all forms of terrain excited us and thus we took the decision of making a hovercraft .The primary motive for all us was to learn through this project . So all four of us started researching different aspects of the hovercraft on the net . Once the team had a general idea, each one of us took one subpart of the vehicle and studied it throughly, such as its function, its positioning,cost and better alternatives. Pranshu took the skirt, Shubham took the electrical part ,Satyendra the mechanical part while Abhijeet looked over the base of our craft. Thus we came to know the physics behind the hovercraft but the engineering was still left</p><p>At this point we first consulted our mentor. By talking to him we came to know that there were few seniors in the institute who had previously made a similar project . So we then went meeting these people (about 4 of them) and asked them about their own hovercraft . This gave us a rough idea for the project .</p><p> We concluded that if we are to make a bot which has to travel on both the mediums then two separate motors will be needed . This in turn implied that a battery with above average mAh rating would be needed . On consulting with Yograj Mandloi, our aero mentor, we decided that a 2200mAh battery would be necessary . In the mean time we also finalized which materials will be best for the craft . Now that we knew all the requirements we set about on purchasing them . With high hopes we went to the famous Lamington Road but in the end were only able to buy the battery and a single propeller. We then resorted to <em>Jugad . </em>We extensively started asking friends who had participated in the RC plane competition to lend us their components. Our running here and there finally proved useful and we were able to collect all the components required. There was much debate about the material required for the skirt . We couldnt get hold of a proper nylon sheet even after much searching...even factories. So we settled upon raincoat material for the skirt </p><p>NOTE - some of us were also attending the sessions conducted by the tree lab </p><p> So we proceeded to make the base . Since we were planning to use two separate motors we needed a base long enough to satisfy this need . The dimensions thus decided were approx. : length- 54cm , Width - 34 cm . Throughout the project we used to work in teams of two so as to make effeccient use of time . Two of us cut the styrofoam for the base while the other two made the support for the two motors . At this point we started to visit the treelab regularly . In fact it was our work station. Then we cut the ceramic plates available in the lab to serve as the clamp for the leaf motor (the one pointed below) .Then came the L - shaped styrofaom for the thrust fan . Meanwhile the other two put the skirt in the bottom part of the craft . Excessive bondtite application as well as taping was done which in hindsight perhaps was not the best thing to do . We always needed to be ensure that the craft will be as light as possible . We cut the chloroplast as well to make the two rudders . Two of us made the grooves to secure the rudders properly in their place while the other two set about to make the Y gate (needed because we were using one battery to power two motors). We asked one of the mentors about soldering, learnt it and made the Y gate . The hole in the skirt too was cut</p><p>The craft was now almost ready . We went to our mentor Raj (who had the transmitter and reciever). He showed us how the wiring went into the reciever and checked that that both the motors were working .Now remained the testing.We were all very anxious at this point. Will our hard work pay off? Our first test made on the rooftop of H7 was a dispointment . The craft was running too slow and that too in cirlces. The problem was obvious - weight balance .</p><p> So we set off to manage all the wires, putting up a place for them and distributed them equally on the left and right sides of the craft . We also made an inverted U shaped structure and attached it over the rudders to give the craft stability and to prevent damage if it ever toppled . We also changed the entire design of the rudders and re positioned them . Test 2 turned out to be a success. There were some more trials in different types of surfaces . We ran the craft in SOM , New SAC , on the slope near Main Building and also on the polished marble floors of VMCC</p><p>So now half of our promises were met . The vehicle glided on land.Testing it on water still remained. However we couldn't find a suitable place for this . Getting permission for the swimming pool was tough , there were fishes in the pool near Main Building and there was no other place such as these in the institute . So we had to settle for the muddy pond in front of the guesthouse. Test 3 - with fear in our hearts we attached a rope to the base and set the craft on water . Raj skillfully manned the craft over water , however it wasn't running fast enough. On dragging the craft out of water we discovered that some water had entered the skirt via its hole and thus slowing it down. The next day we again tried but this time with the hole covered . The craft now glided with an amazing speed even though liitle water had seeped though. We kept finding from where the water was coming in . On checking we found that the skirt wasn't folded properly at some places . So we sealed them off properly . </p><p>We were now quite satisfied with the craft's performance and started the documentation since there was only 3 days left for the final review .</p><p>Below are some <strong>statistics</strong> of the project - </p><ul><li>max. speed(approx.) - 3 m/s</li><li>battery life(on land) - voltage drops from 12.1 to 9 when run for 5 mins.</li><li>battery life(on water) - voltage drops from 12.1 to 11.1 when run for 5 mins.</li><li>No. of trials conducted - around 25 in land and around 5 in water</li><li>tested in various locations such as SOM , VMCC , guesthouse pond , hostel terrace ,slope near M.B(about 15 degrees)and on grass as well. However it didnâ€™t work well on longer grasses .</li></ul>
