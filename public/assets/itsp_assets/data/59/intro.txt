<p>Holograms are the new state of art technology and modern science fiction films' favored way to get the "cool" element in films. Holography is a complicated science and has several sub branches. Some of the holograms are simple to make and require just a few simple components such as glass, spherical mirrors etc.</p><p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/19/article-0-1DFCFF6E00000578-118_634x465.jpg" style="width: 393px;">         <img src="http://media.prologuefilms.com/projects/iron-man-2/vfx-montage/VFX_MONTAGE.jpg" style="width: 509px;"></p><p>               Michael Jackson Hologram (2014),                                                                        Iron Man Holographic Touch Screen</p><p>We made a "holographic touch screen", a touchscreen in the air space where the hologram will form. This touchscreen will help detect the presence of the finger, the position of our finger, and relay the corresponding changes to the LCD screen which acts as the source of the hologram. We are using this touchscreen to implement a calculator to perform integer arithmetic.</p><p>As expected from the description, the project has three parts :-</p><ul>
<li>A Touchscreen module to detect the position of the finger</li><li>An optics mechanism to display the hologram</li><li>An LCD screen to be the source of the hologram</li><li>A microcontroller backend to coordinate the procedure</li></ul><p>An implementation of this project can be found <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/future-touchscreens-projected-thin-air/">here</a>.</p>
