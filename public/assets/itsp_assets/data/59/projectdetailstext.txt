<h4><strong>TOUCHSCREEN MODULE</strong></h4><ul><li>We initially decided to make 4 strips, each having 7 IR Transmitter / Receiver pairs and join it to form a square structure. This would require 28 analog input terminals in Arduino which wasn't possible. We decided to add a 4051 analog multiplexer circuit to each strip to reduce the input terminals into arduino from 28 to 4. These sensors would give a high reading when a finger was placed above it due to reflection of infrared rays.</li><li>We would use Newton's Polynomial to determine the position of the finger studying the values of the IR Sensors.</li><li><strong>FINAL</strong> :- On completing the circuit we weren't getting excellent readings due to interference between adjacent LEDs. This lead us to change the model. In our new model we have two strips consisting of 7 IR LEDs and two strips consisting of 7 IR Receivers placed adjacent to each other one for each axis. Now the voltage would drop as the finger placed will block incoming IR rays from the receivers. This reduced interference tremendously and enabled finger detection easily. We decided to sacrifice multiplexing and Newton's Polynomial due to irregular outputs.</li></ul><h4><strong>OPTICS MODULE</strong></h4><ul><li>We went with the parabolic mirror scheme. Developed two parabolic plastic plates with the assistance of the Plastic Studio at Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay. With the help of Mylar Sheets and Araldite, we created parabolic mirrors. However, we failed to get a clear image due to the folds and creases formed while pasting the sheets.</li><li><strong>FINAL</strong> :- We will form an image using partial reflective nature of plain glass and develop a HUD type hologram</li></ul><h4><strong>LCD DISPLAY MODULE</strong></h4><ul><li>We were initially confused regarding the choice of the LCD. As we couldn't find a suitably sized color LCD, we decided to use a GLCD 128x64.</li><li>We destroyed a capacitor (C2) of the same due to an incorrect connection of the circuit</li><li><strong>FINAL</strong> :- We have settled for a 16x2 LCD Display controlled by Arduino. It will display a calculator's operations and results. We will use a paper touchpad underneath it</li></ul><h4><strong>BACKEND</strong></h4><ul>
<li>We used an Arduino UNO initially. However lost it after 6 days.</li><li>We used an ATMega32 with a programmable board. We faced issues carrying out the USART communication.</li><li><strong>FINAL</strong> :- An Arduino Mega 2560 to coordinate the whole process. It has sufficient analog inputs (14+) for our purpose.</li></ul>
