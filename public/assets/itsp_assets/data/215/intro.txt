<p><strong>VTOL(vertical take off and landing)aircraft </strong>is one that can hover,take off and land vertically.Traditionally in fixed wing aircraft,lot of research has been done to incorporate VTOL feature and to increase the maneuverability of the fixed wing aircraft.The alternative was the Rotary Wing Aircraft like helicopter,tri-copter,quad-copter etc which is more maneuverable and has the VTOL feature.The problem associated with rotary wing aircraft is that their efficiency and very lower range of speed.Other problems like the retreating blade stall are also present.</p><p>Hence the solution to the above mentioned problems is a hybrid aircraft.It will have the advantages of both the fixed wings and rotary wing aircraft and to a large extent should be successful in removing their disadvantages.The V-22 Osprey was the first famous aircraft which incorporated the advantages of both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.The concept used was the tilt rotor mechanism.Since then a lot of work was put into similar Hybrid Mechanisms. </p>
