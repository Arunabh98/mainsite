</ol><p>We
are making a mouse based on accelerometer. <br>
One can move the cursor by simply tilting their hand. <br>
We are using ADXL335 as the accelerometer.<br>We required to use an arduino for processing accelerometer's analog signals and push buttons' output.<br><br>Actually we tried 3 Arduinos due to circumstances and we got to learn very much by this  but each one had their own drawbacks.</p><p>firstly we used<br> <strong>ARDUINO PRO MICRO</strong><br><img class="irc_mi" src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/9/3/2/6/12640-02a.jpg" style="width: 275px;" height="398" width="398"><br>Advantages: it is small in size so, could be easily used on a glove , secondly it has inbuilt HID ( can detected by the pc as mouse or keyboard)</p><p>Drawback: No reset button.</p><p>but due to some reasons it got bricked while uploading the updated code .<br>                  Got Bricked in our case.</p><p>Then , under such circumstances we moved to arduino uno  </p><p><strong>ARDUINO UNO</strong></p><p><img src="http://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/ArduinoUnoSmd450px.jpg" style="width: 246px;" height="318" width="450"> </p><p>Advantages : It was easily avaiable at that time and we taught of changing the firmware on it , so that we could use it as an HID .<br>Drawback: No HID(Human Interface Devices) support. and we were unable to use it as an HID even after changing the firmware using DFU programming , certain functions related to mouse were needed to be added at very elementry level and certain libraries were also required but this stuff was really very complicated and required vey in depth knowledge about serial communications and arduino coding and electronics..</p><p>so , ULTIMATELY we switched to arduino leonardo </p><p><strong>ARDUINO LEONARDO</strong><br><img class="irc_mi" src="http://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/LeonardoNoHeadersFront_2_450px.jpg" height="357" width="450"><br>Advantages : it has an HID and very less chance to get bricked </p><p>Drawbacks: Big in size.</p><p>so, ultimately we are using this arduino leonardo in our ITSP project after various kinds of experiences.
