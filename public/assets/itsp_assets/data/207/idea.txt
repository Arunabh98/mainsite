<li>The basic concept of the project is to be efficiently able to control servo motors using arduino. </li><li>The finger is made of three parts interconnected using hinge joints. A thread goes through the three parts through the holes made and is connected to the servo motor at the both the ends .</li><li>The servo motors are made to pull and release the thread so that the slackening and thightening of the string makes the finger bend and straight. </li><li>Thus the clutching and unclutching action of the hand can be achieved.</li></ul><p>Problems faced:</p><ul>
<li>The most difficult part of the project was to design the parts in such a way that they get interconnected easily and don't bend equally in the opposite direction.</li><li>The three parts interconnected should have the ability to bend like how the human finger works. Thus while clutching the topmost part of the finger shouldn't move earlier than the other parts. </li><li>Getting the parts 3d printed also posed many problems. Since this technology is relatively new the cost of 3d printing is also high. This meant that even a slightest mistake in the design of the parts would make a big loss. This problem was faced with the first finger that we got printed.</li><li>Controlling multiple servo motors with a single arduino was a painful thing. We found out that many people were facing the same problem. The solution we found was to use smaller servo motors instead.</li></ul>
