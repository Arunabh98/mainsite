<p>Following is the description of the design of the part of the finger:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQFdWzXChEo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>To bend the fingers we have used a mechanism of threads.</p><p>The thread goes through the carefully planned holes and moves/bends forward because of the length of the forward thread becoming small by being pulled fownwards towards the arm. </p><p>The same mechanism follows the the thread behind the finger. </p><p>As the string length becomes small by being pulled by the servo motors.
the forward thread is attached to one plate of the fan of servomotor and the backward thread of same finger to the opposite plate of the same fan . </p><p>These threads are tied in such a way that when the fan starts rotating, it should pull the forward thread and backward thread one after another or as instructed by any instrument like potentiometer or any sensor or something else with which you want to control the fingers.</p><p>Here we have controled the finger by potentiometer.</p><p>Following is the description of the design of the part of the finger:</p>
