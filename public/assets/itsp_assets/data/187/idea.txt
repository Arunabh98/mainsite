wheel spokes closes the reed switchcontacts periodicallywhich completes the
circuit thus giving a HIGH output with a certain frequency depending on the speed
of the bicycle. A simple computation considering the wheel diameter gives the
speed of the running bicycle which is then displayed on the LCD display coded
with Arduino.</p><p>The accelerometer helps
determine the angle of the surface on which the bicycle isdriven. </p><p>Based on these outputs
of the slope angle and speed of the bicycle, we have designed conditions that
change the bicycle gear combinations in a way that minimises the efforts of the
rider.</p><p>We have coded these
conditions in Arduino which controls the Servo motor accordingly and pushed the
gear changer with a rack and pinion mechanism, thereby changing the gears.</p>
