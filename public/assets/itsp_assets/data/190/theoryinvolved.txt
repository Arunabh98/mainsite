While this initially appears to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken-and-egg_problem">chicken-and-egg problem</a> there are several algorithms known for solving it, at least approximately, in tractable time for certain environments. Popular approximate solution methods include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter">particle filter</a> and extended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman filter</a>.

An important aspect of the Arduino is its standard connectors, which lets users connect the CPU board to a variety of interchangeable add-on modules known as <em>shields</em>. Some shields communicate with the Arduino board directly over various pins, but many shields are individually addressable via an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I²C</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_bus">serial bus</a>—so many shields can be stacked and used in parallel.

This sensor is perfect for any number of applications that require you to perform measurements between moving or stationary objects.<p>Interfacing to a microcontroller is a snap. A single I/O pin is used to trigger an ultrasonic burst (well above human hearing) and then "listen" for the echo return pulse.

The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current flow in part of the motor. Most types produce rotary motion; a linear motor directly produces force and motion in a straight line.<p>DC motors were the first type widely used, since they could be powered from existing direct-current lighting power distribution systems. A DC motor's speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_motor">universal motor</a> can operate on direct current but is a lightweight motor used for portable power tools and appliances. Larger DC motors are used in propulsion of electric vehicles, elevator and hoists, or in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of power electronics has made replacement of DC motors with AC motors possible in many applications.</p></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Basics of Stepper Motors</span></strong><br>A <strong>stepper motor</strong> (or <strong>step motor</strong>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor">brushless DC electric motor</a> that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps.
