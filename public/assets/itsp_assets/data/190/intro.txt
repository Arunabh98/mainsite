<p>We had planned to study various principles of Swarm Robotics and SLAM and try an implement them into a very primitive model (considering that these are research topics) . We planned to make two bots which will co-ordinate with each other. The task that we decided for it to perform is SLAM. the bots will move about in an arena and give a top view image of the things and shapes present in the arena. </p>
