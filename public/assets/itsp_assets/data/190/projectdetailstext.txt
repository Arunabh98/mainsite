<p>We tried and tested many things before we reached the final product. Here are the details.</p><p>We began with deciding the basic stuff necessary for the project.</p><p>The things that we tried but we failed:</p><p>1. nRF Communication</p><p>We needed to send files . All we could manage was changing the voltage levels of the pins on the other arduino.</p><p>2. PCB Printing</p><p>We learnt how to use Eagle CAD. We succesfully managed to make the .brd file. However after routing and auto-routing some parts we realised that our board had three layers.</p><p>And printing a board with three layers was difficult.</p>
