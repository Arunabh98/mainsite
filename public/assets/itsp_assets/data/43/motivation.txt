<p>There exists many machines that serve the purpose of our project in different ways using different techniques like the bond handwriting bot, but their cost is quite high.  We wanted to make an indigenous machine of our own that can serve the purpose. The reason that our project could be really useful in places where people need to write tediously long documents or repeatedly write a number of times and not only help a user to write a document but to make it realistic have been the motivation for our project. We also saw a similar project which was made in institute in 2013 under ITSP. We wanted to improve and extend that idea and make something special.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhSciWzgR1I" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe>
