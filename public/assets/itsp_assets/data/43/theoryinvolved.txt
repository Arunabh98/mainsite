Since lead threading of lead screw is uniform so distance traveled by nut so platform can be controlled by controlling rotation of screw which is very easy by stepper motor.</p><p>Stepper Motor:</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Stepper motor is different than normal DC motor.As name suggests Control of stepper motor is dependent on two things ,one is RPM and other is number of step/revolution.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Stepper motor can be directly controlled with Arduino . From Arduino you just have to send number of steps to rotate.You can find tutorials very easily.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p>
