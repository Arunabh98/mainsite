<ul><li>The Main Concept behind the Pen Plotter is that a bot writes a selected document in the handwriting of the user by using the images of the letters which the user inputs in the computer. The user needs to store images of all the letters in the computer. When the user runs the program, he selects the document and orders the bot to write that particular document.</li><li>For moving the pen and the platform in a unidirectional straight motion, we converted rotational motion of stepper motors to linear motion by using lead screws. They provide smooth and precise motion compared to other similar mechanisms. The downside is that the efficiency in terms of power consumption is less compared to mechanisms with rack &amp; pinion but since more precision and smoothness proved to be more useful for this project we had opted for the lead screw mechanism.</li></ul><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M20hzrjaFC0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><ul><li>The concept behind controlling the motors through Matlab is that we send a signal through Matlab (containing the necessary data) to Arduino and then accordingly, the Arduino recognizes the signal and performs the necessary function.</li><li>The concept involved in writing the selected text in the user's handwriting is that we use the images of the letters and then after processing through MATLAB, we order the bot to write the necessary.</li><li>The Image Processing of the letters have been done by using the La-Placian filter and getting a binary array representing the letter by converting the image in grey scale.</li><li>The user is going to perform necessary steps through a user-friendly graphical interface made through Matlab.</li></ul>
