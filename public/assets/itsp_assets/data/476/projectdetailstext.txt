<h1>6<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Worked on drafting timeline and coursework of
project. Also made a list of required equipment.</p><p>Pipe, gas hose, water hose, speakers, thin metal
plate, T-joints, connecting crocodile clip wires, 3.5mm jack wire (dual sided),
balloons, cardboard, stand (for pipe and plate), gas cylinder.</p><p>Shopping (lots of it) needs to be done first.</p><h1>7<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Made enquiries of places where we could find the
equipment we needed, in and around IIT campus. Tried at Mangaldeep, where we
were redirected to Bhandup.</p><p>Field trip to Bhandup on cards.</p><h1>8<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Went to Bhandup and bought aluminium pipe, gas hose
and T-joints.</p><p>Raw materials (crude ones) purchased.</p><h1>9<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>With basic raw materials ready, finalised what needs
to be modified with each one of them. Decided that holes need to be drilled in
pipe, gas lines need to be ensured to be leakage-proof and place to perform
fire experiments needs to be found.</p><p>Another trip to modify raw materials into working
state.</p><h1>10<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Tried to look for round speakers needed by us.
Finally found the perfect ones and placed order online. Also, decided to look
for equipment of plate and water expt. too along with fire one, simultaneously
(as advised by mentors, to collect all required equipment as soon as possible)</p><p>Speakers managed. Comprehensive lookout of all
required things underway.</p><h1>11<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Visit to Bhandup for giving pipe for drilling and
capping. Also bought Al plate.</p><p>Decision to start water experiment (part 1) the next
day.</p><h1>12<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Bought dual sided 3.5mm jack cable and connecting
wires. Connected two wire input speaker to laptop via wires and cable. Placed
metal plates (utensils) of various shapes and sizes, filled with water, but no
detectable ripple patterns on water... Ideation needed, since plate technique
not working.</p><h1>13<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Thought processes directed to creating ripples using
sound from speaker. Slight patterns seen on plastic caps of bottles, but not
perceivable to casual eye. Thin vibrating membrane needed. Idea to coat speaker
with plastic and pour water on it. However, on trial, water crosses the layer
and seeps into speaker mainframe. No damage incurred, but plastic idea
scrapped.</p><h1>14<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Replaced plastic with cellophane (“Eureka” moment!)
and working model generated. However, to keep water in proper shape, boundary
needed. First tangible patterns recorded on water, Success!!!</p><h1>15<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Trip to Bhandup to collect pipe and find plate
stand. Realisation that plate is too thick, and needs to be replaced by a
thinner analogue. Pipe not ready, but order plate and stand placed (expected
arrival of plate and pipe on Sunday)</p><h1>16<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Bangle used to confine water. Recording for part 1
of water experiment done. One out of four expts. Finished successfully (sigh of
relief!)</p><h1>17<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Collect ready pipe and plate</p><h1>18<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Tried out plate with basic equipment. Nothing seems
to be happening.</p><h1>19<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Modulated volume and other sound parameters, changed
laptop and music, but no effect on plate. Powder and salt both not working.</p><h1>20<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Change of speakers, but no success</p><h1>21<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Plate seems to be unbalanced, so levelled using
spirit. Plate now vibrating, but no effect on grains.</p><h1>22<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Now, change of grains to sooji, first time movement
detected.</p><h1>23<sup>th</sup> May &amp; 24<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Time off from project, thinking and contacting
mentors for SOS help. Water part2 problems also show up.</p><h1>25<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Meeting with mentors. Change of cover material and
concentrating sound measures suggested.</p><h1>26<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Water part2 apparatus rigorously searched for, and
most parts bought.</p><h1>27<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>New plate apparatus starts showing results.</p><h1>28<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Final display on plate also depends on initial
conditions, hence various initial conditions given a try.</p><h1>29<sup>th</sup> May</h1><p>Finally, Plate expt. ready. Half of ITSP overcome.</p><h1>30<sup>th</sup> May &amp; 31th May</h1><p>Water started, but no success. Meanwhile, fight on for
permission of Ruben’s tube.</p><h1>1<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>All work stalled due to unavailability of proper place
to perform water part2</p><h1>2<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Search on for new place. Meanwhile, miraculously, proper
equipment turns up.</p><h1>3<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Spot found an first demo is a great success.</p><h1>4<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Apparatus calibrated and expt. got into optimum
working condition. 3/4<sup>th</sup> of ITSP – Done.</p><h1>5<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Videos and other data regarding done work collected.</p><h1>6<sup>th</sup> June &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Bills corrected to required format. (money reimbursement
a must...)</p><h1>8<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Videos watched and filtered.</p><h1>9<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Idea of two videos pops up and seems gr8</p><h1>10<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Main video edited. Gr8 going, but Ruben’s tube’s
future bleak.</p><h1>11<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Second video ready, looks better than ever.</p><h1>12<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Everything except Ruben’s tube finished, documented
and logged.</p><h1>13<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Sudden decision to perform Ruben’s tube. All
necessary apparatus got together, despite heavy rains.</p><h1>14<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Ruben’s tube performed, a huge success, looks the
best of the lot. All expts. Over !!!</p><h1>15<sup>th</sup> June</h1><p>Ruben’s tube added and left work completed. ITSP
successfully completed.</p>
