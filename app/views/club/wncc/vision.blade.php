				<h2>Vision of Club</h2>
				<p>
				What makes a university or institute powerful? The resources? We believe it is the ideas, which stem from the people who study or teach in an institute. There is no doubt that Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay attracts the nation's best minds. STAB is an organization which aims at channelizing their ideas into powerful resources, and it does succeed to an extent.  
 				</p><p>
				'Web and Coding Club' under the aegis of STAB, this year aims to strengthen two weak areas as compared to global students of computer sciences. They are `Network Security` and `Competitive Coding`. 
 				</p><p>	
				`Competitive Coding`, very frankly is a sport and enlists all benefits of it, namely keeping the brain alert and active while `Network Security` is becoming very fashionable as more and more services are utilizing the power of internet.  
 				</p><p>
				Though these are the areas we prioritize this year, our vision enlists stimulating the young minds to think of new ideas and beat them to death. We wish to create an environment which encourages students to take up challenges in the subject, and more importantly have a culture of completing them, which at the ground level involves having more than a prototype; a product along with a documentation. 
 				</p><p>	
				We already provide a platform for research scholars to retrieve human resources to give IT assistance and boost their work. We wish to strengthen this symbiotic relationship. 
				</p><p> 
				Central to all stated above is creating a work culture where we guide the students towards methodically finding a solution to their problems and coming up with results rather than dropping good ideas.
