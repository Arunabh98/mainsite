				<h2>Vision of Club</h2>
				<p>
						In this competitive system of grades and marks and CPI, we have to some extent, forsaken ourselves. 
					We have forgotten to enjoy a subject’s beauty, we have forgotten to relish enthralling concepts that 
					form a base for a subject. Our purpose is to rekindle that feeling of enjoying Physics and Maths. 
					Through the events of Maths and Physics Club, people should find that lost desire to be intellectually 
					stimulated by the beauty of Maths and Physics. MnP Club is a community of people from different walks
					of life all driven by their curiosity for Maths and Physics. A community that is as passionate about 
					Maths and Physics as Michael Jordan is for Basketball. To quote Tyrrion Lannister “A mind needs books
					 as a sword needs a whetstone” and we, the MnP club intends to provide that metaphorical whetstone to 
					 the student community of IIT Bombay. Through our events, we will provide you a platform to explore and 
					 delve deeper into this awe-inspiring realm of Maths and Physics.
